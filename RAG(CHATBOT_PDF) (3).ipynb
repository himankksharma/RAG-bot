I\\ncan’t stop thinking about this book.”\\n—Gretchen Rubin, New York Times bestselling author of\\nThe Happiness Project and Happiness at Home\\n“In Daring Greatly, Brené Brown refers to herself as both a mapmaker and a\\ntraveler. In my book, that makes her a guide. And I believe the world needs more\\nguides like her who are showing us a wiser way to our inner world. If you’d like\\nto set your course on being more courageous and connected, engaged and\\nresilient, leave the GPS at home. Daring Greatly is all the navigation you’ll\\nneed.”\\n—Maria Shriver, New York Times bestselling author of\\nJust Who Will You Be?\\n“Daring Greatly is an important book—a timely warning about the danger of\\npursuing certainty and control above all. Brené Brown offers all of us a valuable\\nguide to the real reward of vulnerability: greater courage.”\\n—Daniel H. Pink, New York Times bestselling author of\\nDrive and A Whole New Mind\\n“What I find remarkable about this book is the unique combination of solid\\nresearch and kitchen-table storytelling. Brené becomes such a real person in the\\nbook that you can actually hear her voice asking, ‘Have you dared greatly\\ntoday?’ The invitation in this book is clear: We must be larger than anxiety, fear,\\nand shame if we want to speak, act, and show up. The world needs this book and\\nBrené’s unique blend of warmth, humor, and butt-kicking makes her the perfect\\nperson to inspire us to dare greatly.”\\n—Harriet Lerner, Ph.D., New York Times bestselling author of The Dance of\\nAnger and Marriage Rules:\\nA Manual for the Married and the Coupled Up\\n“One of the tragic ironies of modern life is that so many people feel isolated\\nfrom each other by the very feelings they have in common: including a fear of\\nfailure and a sense of not being enough. Brené Brown shines a bright light into\\nthese dark recesses of human emotion and reveals how these feelings can gnaw\\nat fulfillment in education, at work, and in the home. She shows too how they\\ncan be transformed to help us live more wholehearted lives of courage,\\nengagement, and purpose.

So when she definitively lands on the one most important value\\nwe can cultivate for professional success, relationship health, parental joy, and\\ncourageous, passionate living…well, I sit up and take notice. And even when\\nthat one most critical value turns out to be the risky act of being vulnerable.\\nBrené dared greatly to write this book, and you will benefit greatly to read it and\\nto put its razor-sharp wisdom into action in your own life and work.”\\n—Elizabeth Lesser, New York Times bestselling author of\\nBroken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow\\nand cofounder of the Omega Institute\\n“In an age of constant pressure to conform and pretend, Daring Greatly offers a\\ncompelling alternative: Transform your life by being who you really are.\\nEmbrace the courage to be vulnerable.

Everything I’ve\\nlearned from over a decade of research on vulnerability has taught me this exact\\nlesson. Vulnerability is not knowing victory or defeat, it’s understanding the\\nnecessity of both; it’s engaging. It’s being all in.\\nVulnerability is not weakness, and the uncertainty, risk, and emotional\\nexposure we face every day are not optional. Our only choice is a question of\\nengagement. Our willingness to own and engage with our vulnerability\\ndetermines the depth of our courage and the clarity of our purpose; the level to\\nwhich we protect ourselves from being vulnerable is a measure of our fear and\\ndisconnection.\\nWhen we spend our lives waiting until we’re perfect or bulletproof before we\\nwalk into the arena, we ultimately sacrifice relationships and opportunities that\\nmay not be recoverable, we squander our precious time, and we turn our backs\\non our gifts, those unique contributions that only we can make.\\nPerfect and bulletproof are seductive, but they don’t exist in the human\\nexperience. We must walk into the arena, whatever it may be—a new\\nrelationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family\\nconversation—with courage and the willingness to engage. Rather than sitting\\non the sidelines and hurling judgment and advice, we must dare to show up\\nand let ourselves be seen. This is vulnerability. This is daring greatly.\\nJoin me as we explore the answers to these questions:\\nWhat drives our fear of being vulnerable?\\nHow are we protecting ourselves from vulnerability?\\nWhat price are we paying when we shut down and disengage?\\nHow do we own and engage with vulnerability so we can start transforming\\nthe way we live, love, parent, and lead?\\nINTRODUCTION:\\nMY ADVENTURES\\nIN THE ARENA\\nI looked right at her and said, “I frickin’ hate vulnerability.” I figured she’s a\\ntherapist—I’m sure she’s had tougher cases. Plus, the sooner she knows what\\nshe’s dealing with, the faster we can get this whole therapy thing wrapped up. “I\\nhate uncertainty. I hate not knowing. I can’t stand opening myself to getting hurt\\nor being disappointed. It’s excruciating. Vulnerability is complicated. And it’s\\nexcruciating. Do you know what I mean?”\\nDiana nods. “Yes, I know vulnerability. I know it well. It’s an exquisite\\nemotion.” Then she looks up and kind of smiles, as if she’s picturing something\\nreally beautiful. I’m sure I look confused because I can’t imagine what she’s\\npicturing. I’m suddenly concerned for her well-being and my own.\\n“I said it was excruciating, not exquisite,” I point out. “And let me say this for\\nthe record, if my research didn’t link being vulnerable with living a\\nWholehearted life, I wouldn’t be here. I hate how it makes me feel.”\\n“What does it feel like?”\\n“Like I’m coming out of my skin. Like I need to fix whatever’s happening and\\nmake it better.”\\n“And if you can’t?”\\n“Then I feel like punching someone in the face.”\\n“And do you?”\\n“No. Of course not.”\\n“So what do you do?”\\n“Clean the house. Eat peanut butter. Blame people. Make everything around\\nme perfect. Control whatever I can—whatever’s not nailed down.”\\n“When do you feel the most vulnerable?”\\n“When I’m in fear.” I look up as Diana responds with that annoying pause and\\nhead-nodding done by therapists to draw us out. “When I’m anxious and unsure\\nabout how things are going to go, or if I’m having a difficult conversation, or if\\nI’m trying something new or doing something that makes me uncomfortable or\\nopens me up to criticism or judgment.” Another annoying pause as the empathic\\nnodding continues. “When I think about how much I love my kids and Steve,\\nand how my life would be over if something happened to them. When I see the\\npeople I care about struggling, and I can’t fix it or make it better. All I can do is\\nbe with them.”\\n“I see.”\\n“I feel it when I’m scared that things are too good. Or too scary. I’d really like\\nfor it to be exquisite, but right now it’s just excruciating. Can people change\\nthat?”\\n“Yes, I believe they can.”\\n“Can you give me some homework or something? Should I review the data?”\\n“No data and no homework. No assignments or gold stars in here. Less\\nthinking. More feeling.”\\n“Can I get to exquisite without having to feel really vulnerable in the\\nprocess?”\\n“No.”\\n“Well, shit. That’s just awesome.”\\nIf you don’t know anything about me from my other books, my blog, or the\\nTED videos that have gone viral online, let me catch you up. If, on the other\\nhand, you’re already a little queasy from the mention of a therapist, skip this\\nchapter entirely and go straight to the appendix about my research process. I\\nhave spent my entire life trying to outrun and outsmart vulnerability. I’m a fifth-\\ngeneration Texan with a family motto of “lock and load,” so I come by my\\naversion to uncertainty and emotional exposure honestly (and genetically). By\\nmiddle school, which is the time when most of us begin to wrestle with\\nvulnerability, I began to develop and hone my vulnerability-avoidance skills.\\nOver time I tried everything from “the good girl” with my “perform-perfect-\\nplease” routine, to clove-smoking poet, angry activist, corporate climber, and\\nout-of-control party girl. At first glance these may seem like reasonable, if not\\npredictable, developmental stages, but they were more than that for me. All of\\nmy stages were different suits of armor that kept me from becoming too engaged\\nand too vulnerable. Each strategy was built on the same premise: Keep everyone\\nat a safe distance and always have an exit strategy.\\nAlong with my fear of vulnerability, I also inherited a huge heart and ready\\nempathy. So, in my late twenties, I left a management position at AT&T, got a\\njob waiting tables and bartending, and went back to school to become a social\\nworker. When I met with my boss at AT&T to resign, I’ll never forget her\\nresponse: “Let me guess. You’re leaving to become a social worker or an MTV\\nVJ on Headbanger’s Ball?”\\nLike many of the folks drawn to social work, I liked the idea of fixing people\\nand systems. By the time I was done with my bachelor’s degree (BSW) and was\\nfinishing my master’s degree (MSW), though, I had realized that social work\\nwasn’t about fixing. It was and is all about contextualizing and “leaning in.”\\nSocial work is all about leaning into the discomfort of ambiguity and uncertainty,\\nand holding open an empathic space so people can find their own way. In a word\\n—messy.\\nAs I struggled to figure out how I could ever make a career in social work\\nactually work, I was riveted by a statement from one of my research professors:\\n“If you can’t measure it, it doesn’t exist.” He explained that unlike our other\\nclasses in the program, research was all about prediction and control. I was\\nsmitten. You mean that rather than leaning and holding, I could spend my career\\npredicting and controlling? I had found my calling.\\nThe surest thing I took away from my BSW, MSW, and Ph.D. in social work\\nis this: Connection is why we’re here. We are hardwired to connect with others,\\nit’s what gives purpose and meaning to our lives, and without it there is\\nsuffering. I wanted to develop research that explained the anatomy of\\nconnection.\\nStudying connection was a simple idea, but before I knew it, I had been\\nhijacked by my research participants who, when asked to talk about their most\\nimportant relationships and experiences of connection, kept telling me about\\nheartbreak, betrayal, and shame—the fear of not being worthy of real\\nconnection. We humans have a tendency to define things by what they are not.\\nThis is especially true of our emotional experiences.\\nBy accident, then, I became a shame and empathy researcher, spending six\\nyears developing a theory that explains what shame is, how it works, and how\\nwe cultivate resilience in the face of believing that we’re not enough—that we’re\\nnot worthy of love and belonging. In 2006 I realized that in addition to\\nunderstanding shame, I had to understand the flip side: “What do the people who\\nare the most resilient to shame, who believe in their worthiness—I call these\\npeople the Wholehearted—have in common?”\\nI hoped like hell that the answer to this question would be: “They are shame\\nresearchers. To be Wholehearted, you have to know a lot about shame.” But I\\nwas wrong. Understanding shame is only one variable that contributes to\\nWholeheartedness, a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.\\nIn The Gifts of Imperfection, I defined ten “guideposts” for Wholehearted living\\nthat point to what the Wholehearted work to cultivate and what they work to let\\ngo of:\\n1. Cultivating Authenticity: Letting Go of What People Think\\n2. Cultivating Self-Compassion: Letting Go of Perfectionism\\n3. Cultivating a Resilient Spirit: Letting Go of Numbing and Powerlessness\\n4. Cultivating Gratitude and Joy: Letting Go of Scarcity and Fear of the Dark\\n5. Cultivating Intuition and Trusting Faith: Letting Go of the Need for\\nCertainty\\n6. Cultivating Creativity: Letting Go of Comparison\\n7. Cultivating Play and Rest: Letting Go of Exhaustion as a Status Symbol and\\nProductivity as Self-Worth\\n8. Cultivating Calm and Stillness: Letting Go of Anxiety as a Lifestyle\\n9. Cultivating Meaningful Work: Letting Go of Self-Doubt and “Supposed\\nTo”\\n10. Cultivating Laughter, Song, and Dance: Letting Go of Being Cool and\\n“Always in Control”\\nAs I analyzed the data, I realized that I was about two for ten in my own life\\nwhen in comes to Wholehearted living. That was personally devastating. This\\nhappened a few weeks before my forty-first birthday and sparked my midlife\\nunraveling. As it turns out, getting an intellectual handle on these issues isn’t the\\nsame as living and loving with your whole heart.\\nI have written in great detail in The Gifts of Imperfection about what it means\\nto be Wholehearted and about the breakdown spiritual awakening that ensued\\nfrom this realization. But what I want to do here is to share the definition of\\nWholehearted living and share the five most important themes that emerged\\nfrom the data and which led me to the breakthroughs I share in this book. It will\\ngive you an idea of what’s ahead:\\nWholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness.\\nIt means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the\\nmorning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am\\nenough. It’s going to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable\\nand sometimes afraid, but that doesn’t change the truth that I am also brave and\\nworthy of love and belonging.\\nThis definition is based on these fundamental ideals:\\n1. Love and belonging are irreducible needs of all men, women, and children.\\nWe’re hardwired for connection—it’s what gives purpose and meaning to\\nour lives. The absence of love, belonging, and connection always leads to\\nsuffering.\\n2. If you roughly divide the men and women I’ve interviewed into two groups\\n—those who feel a deep sense of love and belonging, and those who\\nstruggle for it—there’s only one variable that separates the groups: Those\\nwho feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging simply believe\\nthey are worthy of love and belonging. They don’t have better or easier\\nlives, they don’t have fewer struggles with addiction or depression, and they\\nhaven’t survived fewer traumas or bankruptcies or divorces, but in the\\nmidst of all of these struggles, they have developed practices that enable\\nthem to hold on to the belief that they are worthy of love, belonging, and\\neven joy.\\n3. A strong belief in our worthiness doesn’t just happen—it’s cultivated when\\nwe understand the guideposts as choices and daily practices.\\n4. The main concern of Wholehearted men and women is living a life defined\\nby courage, compassion, and connection.\\n5. The Wholehearted identify vulnerability as the catalyst for courage,\\ncompassion, and connection. In fact, the willingness to be vulnerable\\nemerged as the single clearest value shared by all of the women and men\\nwhom I would describe as Wholehearted. They attribute everything—from\\ntheir professional success to their marriages to their proudest parenting\\nmoments—to their ability to be vulnerable.\\nI had written about vulnerability in my earlier books; in fact, there’s even a\\nchapter on it in my dissertation. From the very beginning of my investigations,\\nembracing vulnerability emerged as an important category. I also understood the\\nrelationships between vulnerability and the other emotions that I’ve studied. But\\nin those previous books, I assumed that the relationships between vulnerability\\nand different constructs like shame, belonging, and worthiness were coincidence.\\nOnly after twelve years of dropping deeper and deeper into this work did I\\nfinally understand the role it plays in our lives. Vulnerability is the core, the\\nheart, the center, of meaningful human experiences.\\nThis new information created a major dilemma for me personally: On the one\\nhand, how can you talk about the importance of vulnerability in an honest and\\nmeaningful way without being vulnerable? On the other hand, how can you be\\nvulnerable without sacrificing your legitimacy as a researcher? To be honest, I\\nthink emotional accessibility is a shame trigger for researchers and academics.\\nVery early in our training, we are taught that a cool distance and inaccessibility\\ncontribute to prestige, and that if you’re too relatable, your credentials come into\\nquestion. While being called pedantic is an insult in most settings, in the ivory\\ntower we’re taught to wear the pedantic label like a suit of armor.\\nHow could I risk being really vulnerable and tell stories about my own messy\\njourney through this research without looking like a total flake? What about my\\nprofessional armor?\\nMy moment to “dare greatly,” as Theodore Roosevelt once urged citizens to\\ndo, came in June 2010 when I was invited to speak at TEDxHouston.\\nTEDxHouston is one of many independently organized events modeled after\\nTED—a nonprofit addressing the worlds of Technology, Entertainment, and\\nDesign that is devoted to “Ideas Worth Spreading.” TED and TEDx organizers\\nbring together “the world’s most fascinating thinkers and doers” and challenge\\nthem to give the talk of their life in eighteen minutes or less.\\nThe TEDxHouston curators were unlike any event organizers I’ve known.\\nBringing in a shame-and-vulnerability researcher makes most organizers a little\\nnervous and compels a few to get somewhat prescriptive about the content of the\\ntalk. When I asked the TEDx people what they wanted me to talk about, they\\nresponded, “We love your work. Talk about whatever makes you feel awesome\\n—do your thing. We’re grateful to share the day with you.” Actually, I’m not\\nsure how they made the decision to let me do my thing, because before that talk I\\nwasn’t aware of having a thing.\\nI loved the freedom of that invitation and I hated it. I was back straddling the\\ntension between leaning into the discomfort and finding refuge in my old\\nfriends, prediction and control. I decided to go for it. Truthfully, I had no idea\\nwhat I was getting into.\\nMy decision to dare greatly didn’t stem from self-confidence as much as it did\\nfrom faith in my research. I know I’m a good researcher, and I trusted that the\\nconclusions I had drawn from the data were valid and reliable. Vulnerability\\nwould take me where I wanted or maybe needed to go. I also convinced myself\\nthat it wasn’t really a big deal: It’s Houston, a hometown crowd. Worst-case\\nscenario, five hundred people plus a few watching the live streaming will think\\nI’m a nut.\\nThe morning after the talk, I woke up with one of the worst vulnerability\\nhangovers of my life. You know that feeling when you wake up and everything\\nfeels fine until the memory of laying yourself open washes over you and you\\nwant to hide under the covers? What did I do? Five hundred people officially\\nthink I’m crazy and it totally sucks. I forgot to mention two important things. Did\\nI actually have a slide with the word breakdown on it to reinforce the story that I\\nshouldn’t have told in the first place? I must leave town.\\nBut there was nowhere to run. Six months after the talk, I received an e-mail\\nfrom the curators of TEDxHouston congratulating me because my talk was\\ngoing to be featured on the main TED website. I knew that was a good thing, a\\ncoveted honor even, but I was terrified. First, I was just settling into the idea of\\n“only” five hundred people thinking I’m crazy. Second, in a culture full of critics\\nand cynics, I had always felt safer in my career flying right under the radar.\\nLooking back, I’m not sure how I would have responded to that e-mail had I\\nknown that having a video go viral on vulnerability and the importance of letting\\nourselves be seen would leave me feeling so uncomfortably (and ironically)\\nvulnerable and exposed.\\nToday that talk is one of the most viewed on TED.com, with more than five\\nmillion hits and translation available in thirty-eight languages. I’ve never\\nwatched it. I’m glad I did it, but it still makes me feel really uncomfortable.\\nThe way I see it, 2010 was the year of the TEDxHouston talk, and 2011 was\\nthe year of walking the talk—literally. I crisscrossed the country speaking to\\ngroups ranging from Fortune 500 companies, leadership coaches, and the\\nmilitary, to lawyers, parenting groups, and school districts. In 2012, I was invited\\nto give another talk at the main TED conference in Long Beach, California. For\\nme the 2012 talk was my opportunity to share the work that has literally been the\\nfoundation and springboard for all of my research—I talked about shame and\\nhow we have to understand it and work through it if we really want to dare\\ngreatly.\\nThe experience of sharing my research led me to write this book. After\\ndiscussions with my publisher about the possibility of a business book and/or a\\nparenting book, plus a book for teachers, I realized that there only needed to be\\none book because no matter where I went or with whom I was speaking, the core\\nissues were the same: fear, disengagement, and yearning for more courage.\\nMy corporate talks almost always focus on inspired leadership or creativity\\nand innovation. The most significant problems that everyone from C-level\\nexecutives to the frontline folks talk to me about stem from disengagement, the\\nlack of feedback, the fear of staying relevant amid rapid change, and the need for\\nclarity of purpose. If we want to reignite innovation and passion, we have to\\nrehumanize work. When shame becomes a management style, engagement dies.\\nWhen failure is not an option we can forget about learning, creativity, and\\ninnovation.\\nWhen it comes to parenting, the practice of framing mothers and fathers as\\ngood or bad is both rampant and corrosive—it turns parenting into a shame\\nminefield. The real questions for parents should be: “Are you engaged? Are you\\npaying attention?” If so, plan to make lots of mistakes and bad decisions.\\nImperfect parenting moments turn into gifts as our children watch us try to\\nfigure out what went wrong and how we can do better next time. The mandate is\\nnot to be perfect and raise happy children. Perfection doesn’t exist, and I’ve\\nfound that what makes children happy doesn’t always prepare them to be\\ncourageous, engaged adults. The same is true for schools. I haven’t encountered\\na single problem that isn’t attributed to some combination of parental, teacher,\\nadministrative, and/or student disengagement and the clash of competing\\nstakeholders vying to define one purpose.\\nI have found that the most difficult and most rewarding challenge of my work\\nis how to be both a mapmaker and a traveler. My maps, or theories, on shame\\nresilience, Wholeheartedness, and vulnerability have not been drawn from the\\nexperiences of my own travels, but from the data I’ve collected over the past\\ndozen years—the experiences of thousands of men and women who are forging\\npaths in the direction that I, and many others, want to take our lives.\\nOver the years I’ve learned that a surefooted and confident mapmaker does\\nnot a swift traveler make. I stumble and fall, and I constantly find myself\\nneeding to change course. And even though I’m trying to follow a map that I’ve\\ndrawn, there are many times when frustration and self-doubt take over, and I\\nwad up that map and shove it into the junk drawer in my kitchen. It’s not an easy\\njourney from excruciating to exquisite, but for me it’s been worth every step.\\nWhat we all share in common—what I’ve spent the past several years talking\\nto leaders, parents, and educators about—is the truth that forms the very core of\\nthis book: What we know matters, but who we are matters more. Being rather\\nthan knowing requires showing up and letting ourselves be seen. It requires us to\\ndare greatly, to be vulnerable. The first step of that journey is understanding\\nwhere we are, what we’re up against, and where we need to go. I think we can\\nbest do that by examining our pervasive “Never Enough” culture.\\nCHAPTER 1\\nSCARCITY:\\nLOOKING INSIDE OUR CULTURE OF “NEVER\\nENOUGH”\\nAfter doing this work for the past twelve years and watching scarcity ride roughshod over our families, organizations, and\\ncommunities, I’d say the one thing we have in common is that we’re sick of feeling afraid. We want to dare greatly. We’re\\ntired of the national conversation centering on “What should we fear?” and “Who should we blame?” We all want to be brave.\\nYOU can’t swing a cat without hitting a narcissist.”\\nGranted, it wasn’t my most eloquent moment onstage. It also wasn’t my\\nintention to offend anyone, but when I’m really fired up or frustrated, I tend to\\nrevert back to the language instilled in me by the generations of Texans who\\ncame before me. I swing cats, things get stuck in my craw, and I’m frequently\\n“fixin’ to come undone.” These regressions normally happen at home or when\\nI’m with family and friends, but occasionally, when I’m feeling ornery, they slip\\nout onstage.\\nI’ve heard and used the swinging-cat expression my entire life, and it didn’t\\ndawn on me that more than a few of the thousand members of the audience were\\npicturing me knocking over self-important folks with an actual feline. In my\\ndefense, while responding to numerous e-mails sent by audience members who\\nthought animal cruelty was inconsistent with my message of vulnerability and\\nconnection, I did learn that the expression has nothing to do with animals. It’s\\nactually a British Navy reference to the difficulty of using a cat-o’-nine-tails in\\nthe tight quarters of a ship. I know. Not so great either.\\nIn this particular instance, the cat-swinging was triggered when a woman from\\nthe audience shouted out, “The kids today think they’re so special. What’s\\nturning so many people into narcissists?” My less-than-stellar response verged\\non smart-alecky: “Yeah. You can’t swing a cat without hitting a narcissist.” But\\nit stemmed from a frustration that I still feel when I hear the term narcissism\\nthrown around. Facebook is so narcissistic. Why do people think what they’re\\ndoing is so important? The kids today are all narcissists. It’s always me, me, me.\\nMy boss is such a narcissist. She thinks she’s better than everyone and is always\\nputting other people down.\\nAnd while laypeople are using narcissism as a catchall diagnosis for\\neverything from arrogance to rude behavior, researchers and helping\\nprofessionals are testing the concept’s elasticity in every way imaginable.\\nRecently a group of researchers conducted a computer analysis of three decades\\nof hit songs. The researchers reported a statistically significant trend toward\\nnarcissism and hostility in popular music. In line with their hypothesis, they\\nfound a decrease in usages such as we and us and an increase in I and me.\\nThe researchers also reported a decline in words related to social connection\\nand positive emotions, and an increase in words related to anger and antisocial\\nbehavior, such as hate or kill. Two of the researchers from that study, Jean\\nTwenge and Keith Campbell, authors of the book The Narcissism Epidemic,\\nargue that the incidence of narcissistic personality disorder has more than\\ndoubled in the United States in the last ten years.\\nRelying on yet another fine saying from my grandmother, it feels like the\\nworld is going to hell in a handbasket.\\nOr is it? Are we surrounded by narcissists? Have we turned into a culture of\\nself-absorbed, grandiose people who are only interested in power, success,\\nbeauty, and being special? Are we so entitled that we actually believe that we’re\\nsuperior even when we’re not really contributing or achieving anything of value?\\nIs it true that we lack the necessary empathy to be compassionate, connected\\npeople?\\nIf you’re like me, you’re probably wincing a bit and thinking, Yes. This is\\nexactly the problem. Not with me, of course. But in general…this sounds about\\nright!\\nIt feels good to have an explanation, especially one that conveniently makes\\nus feel better about ourselves and places the blame on those people. In fact,\\nwhenever I hear people making the narcissism argument, it’s normally served\\nwith a side of contempt, anger, and judgment. I’ll be honest, I even felt those\\nemotions when I was writing that paragraph.\\nOur first inclination is to cure “the narcissists” by cutting them down to size.\\nIt doesn’t matter if I’m talking to teachers, parents, CEOs, or my neighbors, the\\nresponse is the same: These egomaniacs need to know that they’re not special,\\nthey’re not that great, they’re not entitled to jack, and they need to get over\\nthemselves. No one cares. (This is the G-rated version.)\\nHere’s where it gets tricky. And frustrating. And maybe even a little\\nheartbreaking. The topic of narcissism has penetrated the social consciousness\\nenough that most people correctly associate it with a pattern of behaviors that\\ninclude grandiosity, a pervasive need for admiration, and a lack of empathy.\\nWhat almost no one understands is how every level of severity in this diagnosis\\nis underpinned by shame. Which means we don’t “fix it” by cutting people down\\nto size and reminding folks of their inadequacies and smallness. Shame is more\\nlikely to be the cause of these behaviors, not the cure.\\nLOOKING AT NARCISSISM THROUGH\\nTHE LENS OF VULNERABILITY\\nDiagnosing and labeling people whose struggles are more environmental or\\nlearned than genetic or organic is often far more detrimental to healing and\\nchange than it is helpful. And when we have an epidemic on our hands, unless\\nwe’re talking about something physically contagious, the cause is much more\\nlikely to be environmental than a hardwiring issue. Labeling the problem in a\\nway that makes it about who people are rather than the choices they’re making\\nlets all of us off the hook: Too bad. That’s who I am. I’m a huge believer in\\nholding people accountable for their behaviors, so I’m not talking about\\n“blaming the system” here. I’m talking about understanding the root cause so we\\ncan address the problems.\\nIt’s often helpful to recognize patterns of behaviors and to understand what\\nthose patterns may indicate, but that’s far different from becoming defined by a\\ndiagnosis, which is something I believe, and that the research shows, often\\nexacerbates shame and prevents people from seeking help.\\nWe need to understand these trends and influences, but I find it far more\\nhelpful, and even transformative in many instances, to look at the patterns of\\nbehaviors through the lens of vulnerability. For example, when I look at\\nnarcissism through the vulnerability lens, I see the shame-based fear of being\\nordinary. I see the fear of never feeling extraordinary enough to be noticed, to\\nbe lovable, to belong, or to cultivate a sense of purpose. Sometimes the simple\\nact of humanizing problems sheds an important light on them, a light that often\\ngoes out the minute a stigmatizing label is applied.\\nThis new definition of narcissism offers clarity and it illuminates both the\\nsource of the problem and possible solutions. I can see exactly how and why\\nmore people are wrestling with how to believe they are enough. I see the cultural\\nmessaging everywhere that says that an ordinary life is a meaningless life. And I\\nsee how kids that grow up on a steady diet of reality television, celebrity culture,\\nand unsupervised social media can absorb this messaging and develop a\\ncompletely skewed sense of the world. I am only as good as the number of\\n“likes” I get on Facebook or Instagram.\\nBecause we are all vulnerable to the messaging that drives these behaviors,\\nthis new lens takes away the us-versus-those-damn-narcissists element. I know\\nthe yearning to believe that what I’m doing matters and how easy it is to confuse\\nthat with the drive to be extraordinary. I know how seductive it is to use the\\ncelebrity culture yardstick to measure the smallness of our lives. And I also\\nunderstand how grandiosity, entitlement, and admiration-seeking feel like just\\nthe right balm to soothe the ache of being too ordinary and inadequate. Yes,\\nthese thoughts and behaviors ultimately cause more pain and lead to more\\ndisconnection, but when we’re hurting and when love and belonging are hanging\\nin the balance, we reach for what we think will offer us the most protection.\\nThere are certainly instances when a diagnosis might be necessary if we are to\\nfind the right treatment, but I can’t think of one example where we don’t benefit\\nby also examining the struggle through the lens of vulnerability. Something can\\nalways be learned when we consider these questions:\\n1. What are the messages and expectations that define our culture and how\\ndoes culture influence our behaviors?\\n2. How are our struggles and behaviors related to protecting ourselves?\\n3. How are our behaviors, thoughts, and emotions related to vulnerability and\\nthe need for a strong sense of worthiness?\\nIf we go back to the earlier question of whether or not we’re surrounded by\\npeople with narcissistic personality disorder, my answer is no. There is a\\npowerful cultural influence at play right now, and I think the fear of being\\nordinary is a part of it, but I also think it goes deeper than that. To find the\\nsource, we have to pan out past the name-calling and labeling.\\nWe’ve had the vulnerability lens zoomed in here on a few specific behaviors,\\nbut if we pull out as wide as we can, the view changes. We don’t lose sight of the\\nproblems we’ve been discussing, but we see them as part of a larger landscape.\\nThis allows us to accurately identify the greatest cultural influence of our time—\\nthe environment that not only explains what everyone is calling a narcissism\\nepidemic, but also provides a panoramic view of the thoughts, behaviors, and\\nemotions that are slowly changing who we are and how we live, love, work,\\nlead, parent, govern, teach, and connect with one another. This environment I’m\\ntalking about is our culture of scarcity.\\nSCARCITY: THE NEVER-ENOUGH PROBLEM\\nA critical aspect of my work is finding language that accurately represents the\\ndata and deeply resonates with participants. I know I’m off when people look as\\nif they’re pretending to get it, or if they respond to my terms and definitions with\\n“huh” or “sounds interesting.” Given the topics I study, I know that I’m onto\\nsomething when folks look away, quickly cover their faces with their hands, or\\nrespond with “ouch,” “shut up,” or “get out of my head.” The last is normally\\nhow \\npeople \\nrespond \\nwhen \\nthey \\nhear \\nor \\nsee \\nthe \\nphrase: \\nNever\\n________________ enough. It only takes a few seconds before people fill in the\\nblanks with their own tapes:\\nNever good enough\\nNever perfect enough\\nNever thin enough\\nNever powerful enough\\nNever successful enough\\nNever smart enough\\nNever certain enough\\nNever safe enough\\nNever extraordinary enough\\nWe get scarcity because we live it.\\nOne of my very favorite writers on scarcity is global activist and fund-raiser\\nLynne Twist. In her book The Soul of Money, she refers to scarcity as “the great\\nlie.” She writes:\\nFor me, and for many of us, our first waking thought of the day is “I didn’t get enough sleep.” The next one is “I don’t have\\nenough time.” Whether true or not, that thought of not enough occurs to us automatically before we even think to question or\\nexamine it. We spend most of the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we\\ndon’t have enough of.…Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we’re already inadequate, already\\nbehind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at night, our minds are racing with a litany of\\nwhat we didn’t get, or didn’t get done, that day. We go to sleep burdened by those thoughts and wake up to that reverie of lack.\\n…This internal condition of scarcity, this mind-set of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our prejudice,\\nand our arguments with life.…(43–45).\\nScarcity is the “never enough” problem. The word scarce is from the Old\\nNorman French scars, meaning “restricted in quantity” (c. 1300). Scarcity\\nthrives in a culture where everyone is hyperaware of lack. Everything from\\nsafety and love to money and resources feels restricted or lacking. We spend\\ninordinate amounts of time calculating how much we have, want, and don’t\\nhave, and how much everyone else has, needs, and wants.\\nWhat makes this constant assessing and comparing so self-defeating is that we\\nare often comparing our lives, our marriages, our families, and our communities\\nto unattainable, media-driven visions of perfection, or we’re holding up our\\nreality against our own fictional account of how great someone else has it.\\nNostalgia is also a dangerous form of comparison. Think about how often we\\ncompare ourselves and our lives to a memory that nostalgia has so completely\\nedited that it never really existed: “Remember when…? Those were the days…”\\nTHE SOURCE OF SCARCITY\\nScarcity doesn’t take hold in a culture overnight. But the feeling of scarcity does\\nthrive in shame-prone cultures that are deeply steeped in comparison and\\nfractured by disengagement. (By a shame-prone culture, I don’t mean that we’re\\nashamed of our collective identity, but that there are enough of us struggling\\nwith the issue of worthiness that it’s shaping the culture.)\\nOver the past decade, I’ve witnessed major shifts in the zeitgeist of our\\ncountry. I’ve seen it in the data, and honestly, I’ve seen it in the faces of the\\npeople I meet, interview, and talk to. The world has never been an easy place,\\nbut the past decade has been traumatic for so many people that it’s made changes\\nin our culture. From 9/11, multiple wars, and the recession, to catastrophic\\nnatural disasters and the increase in random violence and school shootings,\\nwe’ve survived and are surviving events that have torn at our sense of safety\\nwith such force that we’ve experienced them as trauma even if we weren’t\\ndirectly involved. And when it comes to the staggering numbers of those now\\nunemployed and underemployed, I think every single one of us has been directly\\naffected or is close to someone who has been directly affected.\\nWorrying about scarcity is our culture’s version of post-traumatic stress. It\\nhappens when we’ve been through too much, and rather than coming together to\\nheal (which requires vulnerability), we’re angry and scared and at each other’s\\nthroats. It’s not just the larger culture that’s suffering: I found the same dynamics\\nplaying out in family culture, work culture, school culture, and community\\nculture. And they all share the same formula of shame, comparison, and\\ndisengagement. Scarcity bubbles up from these conditions and perpetuates them\\nuntil a critical mass of people start making different choices and reshaping the\\nsmaller cultures they belong to.\\nOne way to think about the three components of scarcity and how they\\ninfluence culture is to reflect upon the following questions. As you’re reading\\nthe questions, it’s helpful to keep in mind any culture or social system that\\nyou’re a part of, whether your classroom, your family, your community, or\\nmaybe your work team:\\n1. Shame: Is fear of ridicule and belittling used to manage people and/or to\\nkeep people in line? Is self-worth tied to achievement, productivity, or\\ncompliance? Are blaming and finger-pointing norms? Are put-downs and\\nname-calling rampant? What about favoritism? Is perfectionism an issue?\\n2. Comparison: Healthy competition can be beneficial, but is there constant\\novert or covert comparing and ranking? Has creativity been suffocated? Are\\npeople held to one narrow standard rather than acknowledged for their\\nunique gifts and contributions? Is there an ideal way of being or one form\\nof talent that is used as measurement of everyone else’s worth?\\n3. Disengagement: Are people afraid to take risks or try new things? Is it\\neasier to stay quiet than to share stories, experiences, and ideas? Does it feel\\nas if no one is really paying attention or listening? Is everyone struggling to\\nbe seen and heard?\\nWhen I look at these questions and think about our larger culture, the media,\\nand the social-economic-political landscape, my answers are YES, YES, and\\nYES!\\nWhen I think about my family in the context of these questions, I know that\\nthese are the exact issues that my husband, Steve, and I work to overcome every\\nsingle day. I use the word overcome because to grow a relationship or raise a\\nfamily or create an organizational culture or run a school or nurture a faith\\ncommunity, all in a way that is fundamentally opposite to the cultural norms\\ndriven by scarcity, it takes awareness, commitment, and work…every single day.\\nThe larger culture is always applying pressure, and unless we’re willing to push\\nback and fight for what we believe in, the default becomes a state of scarcity.\\nWe’re called to “dare greatly” every time we make choices that challenge the\\nsocial climate of scarcity.\\nThe counterapproach to living in scarcity is not about abundance. In fact, I\\nthink abundance and scarcity are two sides of the same coin. The opposite of\\n“never enough” isn’t abundance or “more than you could ever imagine.” The\\nopposite of scarcity is enough, or what I call Wholeheartedness. As I explained\\nin the Introduction, there are many tenets of Wholeheartedness, but at its very\\ncore is vulnerability and worthiness: facing uncertainty, exposure, and emotional\\nrisks, and knowing that I am enough.\\nIf you go back to the three sets of questions about scarcity that I just posed\\nand ask yourself if you’d be willing to be vulnerable or to dare greatly in any\\nsetting defined by these values, the answer for most of us is a resounding no. If\\nyou ask yourself if these are conditions conducive to cultivating worthiness, the\\nanswer is again no. The greatest casualties of a scarcity culture are our\\nwillingness to own our vulnerabilities and our ability to engage with the world\\nfrom a place of worthiness.\\nAfter doing this work for the past twelve years and watching scarcity ride\\nroughshod over our families, organizations, and communities, I’d say the one\\nthing we have in common is that we’re sick of feeling afraid. We all want to be\\nbrave. We want to dare greatly. We’re tired of the national conversation\\ncentering on “What should we fear?” and “Who should we blame?”\\nIn the next chapter we’ll talk about the vulnerability myths that fuel scarcity\\nand how courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen.\\nCHAPTER 2\\nDEBUNKING\\nTHE VULNERABILITY\\nMYTHS\\nYes, we are totally exposed when we are vulnerable. Yes, we are in the torture chamber that we call uncertainty. And, yes,\\nwe’re taking a huge emotional risk when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable. But there’s no equation where taking risks,\\nbraving uncertainty, and opening ourselves up to emotional exposure equals weakness.\\nMYTH #1: “VULNERABILITY IS WEAKNESS.”\\nThe perception that vulnerability is weakness is the most widely accepted myth\\nabout vulnerability and the most dangerous. When we spend our lives pushing\\naway and protecting ourselves from feeling vulnerable or from being perceived\\nas too emotional, we feel contempt when others are less capable or willing to\\nmask feelings, suck it up, and soldier on. We’ve come to the point where, rather\\nthan respecting and appreciating the courage and daring behind vulnerability, we\\nlet our fear and discomfort become judgment and criticism.\\nVulnerability isn’t good or bad: It’s not what we call a dark emotion, nor is it\\nalways a light, positive experience. Vulnerability is the core of all emotions and\\nfeelings. To feel is to be vulnerable. To believe vulnerability is weakness is to\\nbelieve that feeling is weakness. To foreclose on our emotional life out of a fear\\nthat the costs will be too high is to walk away from the very thing that gives\\npurpose and meaning to living.\\nOur rejection of vulnerability often stems from our associating it with dark\\nemotions like fear, shame, grief, sadness, and disappointment—emotions that we\\ndon’t want to discuss, even when they profoundly affect the way we live, love,\\nwork, and even lead. What most of us fail to understand and what took me a\\ndecade of research to learn is that vulnerability is also the cradle of the emotions\\nand experiences that we crave. Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging,\\njoy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy,\\naccountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or\\ndeeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.\\nI know this is hard to believe, especially when we’ve spent our lives thinking\\nthat vulnerability and weakness are synonymous, but it’s true. I define\\nvulnerability as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. With that\\ndefinition in mind, let’s think about love. Waking up every day and loving\\nsomeone who may or may not love us back, whose safety we can’t ensure, who\\nmay stay in our lives or may leave without a moment’s notice, who may be loyal\\nto the day they die or betray us tomorrow—that’s vulnerability. Love is\\nuncertain. It’s incredibly risky. And loving someone leaves us emotionally\\nexposed. Yes, it’s scary and yes, we’re open to being hurt, but can you imagine\\nyour life without loving or being loved?\\nTo put our art, our writing, our photography, our ideas out into the world with\\nno assurance of acceptance or appreciation—that’s also vulnerability. To let\\nourselves sink into the joyful moments of our lives even though we know that\\nthey are fleeting, even though the world tells us not to be too happy lest we\\ninvite disaster—that’s an intense form of vulnerability.\\nThe profound danger is that, as noted above, we start to think of feeling as\\nweakness. With the exception of anger (which is a secondary emotion, one that\\nonly serves as a socially acceptable mask for many of the more difficult\\nunderlying emotions we feel), we’re losing our tolerance for emotion and hence\\nfor vulnerability.\\nIt starts to make sense that we dismiss vulnerability as weakness only when\\nwe realize that we’ve confused feeling with failing and emotions with liabilities.\\nIf we want to reclaim the essential emotional part of our lives and reignite our\\npassion and purpose, we have to learn how to own and engage with our\\nvulnerability and how to feel the emotions that come with it. For some of us, it’s\\nnew learning, and for others it’s relearning. Either way, the research taught me\\nthat the best place to start is with defining, recognizing, and understanding\\nvulnerability.\\nWhat really brings the definition of vulnerability up close and personal are the\\nexamples people shared when I asked them to finish this sentence stem:\\n“Vulnerability is ______________.” Here are some of the replies:\\nSharing an unpopular opinion\\nStanding up for myself\\nAsking for help\\nSaying no\\nStarting my own business\\nHelping my thirty-seven-year-old wife with Stage 4 breast cancer make\\ndecisions about her will\\nInitiating sex with my wife\\nInitiating sex with my husband\\nHearing how much my son wants to make first chair in the orchestra and\\nencouraging him while knowing that it’s probably not going to happen\\nCalling a friend whose child just died\\nSigning up my mom for hospice care\\nThe first date after my divorce\\nSaying, “I love you,” first and not knowing if I’m going to be loved back\\nWriting something I wrote or a piece of art that I made\\nGetting promoted and not knowing if I’m going to succeed\\nGetting fired\\nFalling in love\\nTrying something new\\nBringing my new boyfriend home\\nGetting pregnant after three miscarriages\\nWaiting for the biopsy to come back\\nReaching out to my son who is going through a difficult divorce\\nExercising in public, especially when I don’t know what I’m doing and I’m\\nout of shape\\nAdmitting I’m afraid\\nStepping up to the plate again after a series of strikeouts\\nTelling my CEO that we won’t make payroll next month\\nLaying off employees\\nPresenting my product to the world and getting no response\\nStanding up for myself and for friends when someone else is critical or\\ngossiping\\nBeing accountable\\nAsking for forgiveness\\nHaving faith\\nDo these sound like weaknesses? Does showing up to be with someone in\\ndeep struggle sound like a weakness? Is accepting accountability weak? Is\\nstepping up to the plate after striking out a sign of weakness? NO. Vulnerability\\nsounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always\\ncomfortable, but they’re never weakness.\\nYes, we are totally exposed when we are vulnerable. Yes, we are in the torture\\nchamber that we call uncertainty. And, yes, we’re taking a huge emotional risk\\nwhen we allow ourselves to be vulnerable. But there’s no equation where taking\\nrisks, braving uncertainty, and opening ourselves up to emotional exposure\\nequals weakness.\\nWhen we asked the question “How does vulnerability feel?” the answers were\\nequally as powerful:\\nIt’s taking off the mask and hoping the real me isn’t too disappointing.\\nNot sucking it in anymore.\\nIt’s where courage and fear meet.\\nYou are halfway across a tightrope, and moving forward and going back are\\nboth just as scary.\\nSweaty palms and a racing heart.\\nScary and exciting; terrifying and hopeful.\\nTaking off a straitjacket.\\nGoing out on a limb—a very, very high limb.\\nTaking the first step toward what you fear the most.\\nBeing all in.\\nIt feels so awkward and scary, but it makes me human and alive.\\nA lump in my throat and a knot in my chest.\\nThe terrifying point on a roller coaster when you’re about to tip over the\\nedge and take the plunge.\\nFreedom and liberation.\\nIt feels like fear, every single time.\\nPanic, anxiety, fear, and hysteria, followed by freedom, pride, and\\namazement—then a little more panic.\\nBaring your belly in the face of the enemy.\\nInfinitely terrifying and achingly necessary.\\nI know it’s happening when I feel the need to strike first before I’m struck.\\nIt feels like free-falling.\\nLike the time between hearing a gunshot and waiting to see if you’re hit.\\nLetting go of control.\\nAnd the answer that appeared over and over in all of our efforts to better\\nunderstand vulnerability? Naked.\\nVulnerability is like being naked onstage and hoping for applause rather\\nthan laughter.\\nIt’s being naked when everyone else is fully clothed.\\nIt feels like the naked dream: You’re in the airport and you’re stark naked.\\nWhen discussing vulnerability, it is helpful to look at the definition and\\netymology of the word vulnerable. According to the Merriam-Webster\\nDictionary, the word vulnerability is derived from the Latin word vulnerare,\\nmeaning “to wound.” The definition includes “capable of being wounded” and\\n“open to attack or damage.” Merriam-Webster defines weakness as the inability\\nto withstand attack or wounding. Just from a linguistic perspective, it’s clear that\\nthese are very different concepts, and in fact, one could argue that weakness\\noften stems from a lack of vulnerability—when we don’t acknowledge how and\\nwhere we’re tender, we’re more at risk of being hurt.\\nPsychology and social psychology have produced very persuasive evidence on\\nthe importance of acknowledging vulnerabilities. From the field of health\\npsychology, studies show that perceived vulnerability, meaning the ability to\\nacknowledge our risks and exposure, greatly increases our chances of adhering\\nto some kind of positive health regimen. In order to get patients to comply with\\nprevention routines, they must work on perceived vulnerability. And what makes\\nthis really interesting is that the critical issue is not about our actual level of\\nvulnerability, but the level at which we acknowledge our vulnerabilities around a\\ncertain illness or threat.\\nFrom the field of social psychology, influence-and-persuasion researchers,\\nwho examine how people are affected by advertising and marketing, conducted a\\nseries of studies on vulnerability. They found that the participants who thought\\nthey were not susceptible or vulnerable to deceptive advertising were, in fact, the\\nmost vulnerable. The researchers’ explanation for this phenomenon says it all:\\n“Far from being an effective shield, the illusion of invulnerability\\nundermines the very response that would have supplied genuine\\nprotection.”\\nOne of the most anxiety-provoking experiences of my career was speaking at the\\nTED Conference in Long Beach that I referenced in the Introduction. In addition\\nto all of the normal fears associated with giving a filmed, eighteen-minute talk in\\nfront of an intensely successful and high-expectation audience, I was the closing\\nspeaker for the entire event. For three days I sat and watched some of the most\\namazing and provocative talks that I’ve ever seen.\\nAfter each talk I slumped a little lower in my chair with the realization that in\\norder for my talk “to work” I’d have to give up trying to do it like everyone else\\nand I’d have to connect with the audience. I desperately wanted to see a talk that\\nI could copy or use as a template, but the talks that resonated the most strongly\\nwith me didn’t follow a format, they were just genuine. This meant that I’d have\\nto be me. I’d have to be vulnerable and open. I’d need to walk away from my\\nscript and look people in the eye. I’d have to be naked. And, oh, my God…I hate\\nnaked. I have recurring nightmares about naked.\\nWhen I finally walked onto the stage the first thing I did was make eye\\ncontact with several people in the audience. I asked the stage managers to bring\\nup the houselights so I could see people. I needed to feel connected. Simply\\nseeing people as people rather than “the audience” reminded me that the\\nchallenges that scare me—like being naked—scare everyone else. I think that’s\\nwhy empathy can be conveyed without speaking a word—it just takes looking\\ninto someone’s eyes and seeing yourself reflected back in an engaged way.\\nDuring my talk I asked the audience two questions that reveal so much about\\nthe many paradoxes that define vulnerability. First I asked, “How many of you\\nstruggle to be vulnerable because you think of vulnerability as weakness?”\\nHands shot up across the room. Then I asked, “When you watched people on this\\nstage being vulnerable, how many of you thought it was courageous?” Again,\\nhands shot up across the room.\\nWe love seeing raw truth and openness in other people, but we’re afraid to let\\nthem see it in us. We’re afraid that our truth isn’t enough—that what we have to\\noffer isn’t enough without the bells and whistles, without editing, and\\nimpressing. I was afraid to walk on that stage and show the audience my\\nkitchen-table self—these people were too important, too successful, too famous.\\nMy kitchen-table self is too messy, too imperfect, too unpredictable.\\nHere’s the crux of the struggle:\\nI want to experience your vulnerability but I don’t want to be vulnerable.\\nVulnerability is courage in you and inadequacy in me.\\nI’m drawn to your vulnerability but repelled by mine.\\nAs I walked on the stage, I focused my thoughts on Steve, who was sitting in\\nthe audience, my sisters back in Texas, and some friends who were watching live\\nfrom TEDActive—an offsite location. I also drew courage from something that I\\nlearned at TED—a very unexpected lesson on failure. The vast majority of folks\\nwhom Steve and I met during the three days leading up to my talk spoke openly\\nabout failing. It wasn’t unusual for someone to tell you about the two or three\\nventures or inventions that had failed as they explained their work or talked\\nabout their passions. I was blown away and inspired.\\nI took a deep breath and recited my vulnerability prayer as I waited for my\\nturn: Give me the courage to show up and let myself be seen. Then, seconds\\nbefore I was introduced, I thought about a paperweight on my desk that reads,\\n“What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?” I pushed that\\nquestion out of my head to make room for a new question. As I walked up to the\\nstage, I literally whispered aloud, “What’s worth doing even if I fail?”\\nI honestly don’t remember much of what I said, but when it was over I was\\nback knee-deep in the vulnerability hangover AGAIN! Was the risk worth it?\\nAbsolutely. I am passionate about my work and I believe in what I’ve learned\\nfrom my research participants. I believe honest conversations about vulnerability\\nand shame can change the world. Both of the talks are flawed and imperfect, but\\nI walked into the arena and gave it my best shot. The willingness to show up\\nchanges us. It makes us a little braver each time. And, I’m not sure how one\\nmeasures the success or failure of a talk, but the minute I was done I knew that\\neven if it flopped or drew criticism, it had been totally worth doing.\\nIn the song “Hallelujah,” Leonard Cohen writes, “Love is not a victory march,\\nit’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah.” Love is a form of vulnerability and if\\nyou replace the word love with vulnerability in that line, it’s just as true. From\\ncalling a friend who’s experienced a terrible tragedy to starting your own\\nbusiness, from feeling terrified to experiencing liberation, vulnerability is life’s\\ngreat dare. It’s life asking, “Are you all in? Can you value your own\\nvulnerability as much as you value it in others?” Answering yes to these\\nquestions is not weakness: It’s courage beyond measure. It’s daring greatly. And\\noften the result of daring greatly isn’t a victory march as much as it is a quiet\\nsense of freedom mixed with a little battle fatigue.\\nMYTH #2: “I DON’T DO VULNERABILITY”\\nWhen we were children, we used to think that when we were grown up we would no longer be vulnerable. But to grow up is to\\naccept vulnerability. To be alive is to be vulnerable.\\n—Madeleine L’Engle\\nThe definition and examples that you just read make busting the second\\nvulnerability myth a lot easier. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard people\\nsay, “Interesting topic, but I don’t do vulnerability.” It’s often buttressed by a\\ngender or professional explanation: “I’m an engineer—we hate vulnerability.”\\n“I’m a lawyer—we eat vulnerability for breakfast.” “Guys don’t do\\nvulnerability.” Trust me, I get it. I’m not a guy or an engineer or a lawyer, but\\nI’ve spoken these exact words a hundred times. Unfortunately, there is no “get\\nout of vulnerability free” card. We can’t opt out of the uncertainty, risk, and\\nemotional exposure that’s woven through our daily experiences. Life is\\nvulnerable.\\nLook back at the list of examples. These are the challenges of being alive, of\\nbeing in a relationship, of being connected. Even if we choose to stay out of\\nrelationships and opt for disconnection as a form of protection, we’re still alive\\nand that means vulnerability happens. When we operate from the belief that we\\n“don’t do vulnerability” it’s extremely helpful to ask ourselves the following\\nquestions. If we truly don’t know the answers, we can bravely ask someone with\\nwhom we are close—they’ll probably have an answer (even if we don’t want to\\nhear it):\\n1. “What do I do when I feel emotionally exposed?”\\n2. “How do I behave when I’m feeling very uncomfortable and uncertain?”\\n3. “How willing am I to take emotional risks?”\\nBefore I started doing this work, my honest answers would have been:\\n1. Scared, angry, judgmental, controlling, perfecting, manufacturing certainty.\\n2. Scared, angry, judgmental, controlling, perfecting, manufacturing certainty.\\n3. At work, very unwilling if criticism, judgment, blame, or shame was\\npossible. Taking emotional risks with the people I love was always mired in\\nfear of something bad happening—a total joy killer that we’ll explore in the\\n“Armory” chapter.\\nThis questioning process helps because, as you can see from my answers,\\nregardless of our willingness to do vulnerability, it does us. When we pretend\\nthat we can avoid vulnerability we engage in behaviors that are often\\ninconsistent with who we want to be. Experiencing vulnerability isn’t a choice—\\nthe only choice we have is how we’re going to respond when we are confronted\\nwith uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. As a huge fan of the band Rush,\\nthis seems like the perfect place to throw in a quote from their song “Freewill”:\\n“If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.”\\nIn Chapter 4 we’ll take a closer look at the conscious and unconscious\\nbehaviors we use to protect ourselves when we believe we’re “not doing\\nvulnerability.”\\nMYTH #3: VULNERABILITY IS LETTING IT ALL\\nHANG OUT\\nOne line of questioning that I often get is about our “let it all hang out” culture.\\nCan’t there be too much vulnerability? Isn’t there such a thing as oversharing?\\nThese questions are inevitably followed by examples from celebrity culture.\\nWhat about when Movie Star X tweeted about her husband’s suicide attempt? Or\\nwhat about reality TV stars who share the intimate details of their lives and their\\nchildren’s lives with the world?\\nVulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust. It’s not\\noversharing, it’s not purging, it’s not indiscriminate disclosure, and it’s not\\ncelebrity-style social media information dumps. Vulnerability is about sharing\\nour feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear\\nthem. Being vulnerable and open is mutual and an integral part of the trust-\\nbuilding process.\\nWe can’t always have guarantees in place before we risk sharing; however, we\\ndon’t bare our souls the first time we meet someone. We don’t lead with “Hi, my\\nname is Brené, and here’s my darkest struggle.” That’s not vulnerability. That\\nmay be desperation or woundedness or even attention-seeking, but it’s not\\nvulnerability. Why? Because sharing appropriately, with boundaries, means\\nsharing with people with whom we’ve developed relationships that can bear the\\nweight of our story. The result of this mutually respectful vulnerability is\\nincreased connection, trust, and engagement.\\nVulnerability without boundaries leads to disconnection, distrust, and\\ndisengagement. In fact, as we’ll explore in Chapter 4, “letting it all hang out” or\\nboundaryless disclosure is one way we protect ourselves from real vulnerability.\\nAnd the TMI (too much information) issue is not even a case of “too much\\nvulnerability”—vulnerability is bankrupt on its own terms when people move\\nfrom being vulnerable to using vulnerability to deal with unmet needs, get\\nattention, or engage in the shock-and-awe behaviors that are so commonplace in\\ntoday’s culture.\\nTo more effectively dispel the myth that vulnerability is a secret-sharing-free-\\nfor-all, let’s examine the issue of trust.\\nWhen I talk to groups about the importance of being vulnerable, there’s\\nalways a flood of questions about the need for trust:\\n“How do I know if I can trust someone enough to be vulnerable?”\\n“I’ll only be vulnerable with someone if I’m sure they won’t turn on me.”\\n“How can you tell who’s got your back?”\\n“How do we build trust with people?”\\nThe good news is that the answers to these questions emerged from the data.\\nThe bad news is that it’s a chicken-or-the-egg issue: We need to feel trust to be\\nvulnerable and we need to be vulnerable in order to trust.\\nThere is no trust test, no scoring system, no green light that tells us that it’s\\nsafe to let ourselves be seen. The research participants described trust as a slow-\\nbuilding, layered process that happens over time. In our family, we refer to trust\\nas “the Marble Jar.”\\nIn the middle of third grade, Ellen had her first experience with betrayal. In\\nmany elementary school settings, third grade is a big move. Students are no\\nlonger clustered with the K–2 crowd; they’re now navigating the Grade 3–5\\ngroup. During recess, she had confided in a friend from her class about a funny,\\nslightly embarrassing thing that had happened to her earlier in the day. By\\nlunchtime, all of the girls in her peer group knew her secret and were giving her\\na hard time. It was an important lesson, but also a painful one, because up to that\\npoint she had never considered the possibility that someone would do that.\\nWhen she came home, she burst into tears and told me that she was never\\ngoing to tell anyone anything again. Her feelings were so hurt. Listening, I felt\\nmy heart aching for her. To make matters worse, Ellen told me that the girls were\\nstill laughing at her when they returned to the classroom, so much so that her\\nteacher separated them and took some marbles out of the marble jar.\\nEllen’s teacher had a large, clear glass vase that she and the kids referred to as\\n“the marble jar.” She kept a bag of colored marbles next to the jar, and whenever\\nthe class was collectively making good choices, she would throw some marbles\\ninto the jar. Whenever the class was acting out, breaking rules, or not listening,\\nthe teacher would take marbles out of the jar. If and when the marbles made it to\\nthe top of the jar, the students would be rewarded with a celebration party.\\nAs much as I wanted to pull Ellen close and whisper, “Not sharing with those\\ngirls is a great idea! That way they’ll never hurt us you again,” I put my fears\\nand anger aside, and started trying to figure out how to talk to her about trust and\\nconnection. As I was searching for the right way to translate my own\\nexperiences of trust, and what I was learning about trust from the research, I\\nthought, Ah, the marble jar. Perfect.\\nI told Ellen to think about her friendships as marble jars. Whenever someone\\nsupports you, or is kind to you, or sticks up for you, or honors what you share\\nwith them as private, you put marbles in the jar. When people are mean, or\\ndisrespectful, or share your secrets, marbles come out. When I asked her if it\\nmade sense, she nodded her head with excitement and said, “I’ve got marble jar\\nfriends! I’ve got marble jar friends!”\\nWhen I asked her to tell me about it, she described four friends whom she\\ncould always count on, who knew some of her secrets and would never tell, and\\nwho told her some of their secrets too. She said, “These are the friends who ask\\nme to sit with them, even if they’ve been asked to sit at the popular kids’ table.”\\nIt was such a great moment for both of us. When I asked her how her marble\\njar friends became marble jar friends, she thought about it for a minute and\\nreplied, “I’m not sure. How did your marble jar friends get their marbles?” After\\nthinking about it for a while, we both started blurting out our answers. Some of\\nhers were:\\nThey keep our secrets.\\nThey tell us their secrets.\\nThey remember my birthday!\\nThey know who Oma and Opa are.\\nThey always make sure I’m included in fun things.\\nThey know when I’m sad and ask me why.\\nWhen I miss school because I’m sick, they ask their moms to call to check on me.\\nAnd mine? Exactly the same (except for me, Oma and Opa are Deanne and\\nDavid, my mom and stepdad). When my mom comes to Ellen or Charlie’s\\nevents, it’s a great feeling to hear one of my friends say, “Hey, Deanne! Good to\\nsee you.” I always think, She remembered my mom’s name. She cares. She’s\\npaying attention.\\nTrust is built one marble at a time.\\nThe chicken-or-the-egg dilemma comes into play when we think about the\\ninvestment and leap that people in relationships have to make before the building\\nprocess ever begins. The teacher didn’t say, “I’m not buying a jar and marbles\\nuntil I know that the class can collectively make good choices.” The jar was\\nthere on the first day of school. In fact, by the end of the first day, she had\\nalready filled the bottom with a layer of marbles. The kids didn’t say, “We’re not\\ngoing to make good choices because we don’t believe you’ll put marbles in the\\njar.” They worked hard and enthusiastically engaged with the marble jar idea\\nbased on their teacher’s word.\\nOne of my favorite scholars in the field of relationships is John Gottman. He’s\\nconsidered the country’s foremost couples researcher because of the power and\\naccessibility of his pioneering work on how we connect and build relationships.\\nHis book The Science of Trust: Emotional Attunement for Couples is an\\ninsightful and wise book on the anatomy of trust and trust building. In an article\\non the University of California–Berkeley’s “Greater Good” website\\n(www.greatergood.berkeley.edu), Gottman describes trust building with our\\npartners in a manner totally consistent with what I found in my research and\\nwhat Ellen and I call the marble jar:\\nWhat I’ve found through research is that trust is built in very small moments, which I call “sliding door” moments, after\\nthe movie Sliding Doors. In any interaction, there is a possibility of connecting with your partner or turning away from your\\npartner.\\nLet me give you an example of that from my own relationship. One night, I really wanted to finish a mystery novel. I\\nthought I knew who the killer was, but I was anxious to find out. At one point in the night, I put the novel on my bedside and\\nwalked into the bathroom.\\nAs I passed the mirror, I saw my wife’s face in the reflection, and she looked sad, brushing her hair. There was a sliding\\ndoor moment.\\nI had a choice. I could sneak out of the bathroom and think, I don’t want to deal with her sadness tonight; I want to read\\nmy novel. But instead, because I’m a sensitive researcher of relationships, I decided to go into the bathroom. I took the brush\\nfrom her hair and asked, “What’s the matter, baby?” And she told me why she was sad.\\nNow, at that moment, I was building trust; I was there for her. I was connecting with her rather than choosing to think only\\nabout what I wanted. These are the moments, we’ve discovered, that build trust.\\nOne such moment is not that important, but if you’re always choosing to turn away, then trust erodes in a relationship—\\nvery gradually, very slowly.\\nWhen we think about betrayal in terms of the marble jar metaphor, most of us\\nthink of someone we trust doing something so terrible that it forces us to grab\\nthe jar and dump out every single marble. What’s the worst betrayal of trust you\\ncan think of? He sleeps with my best friend. She lies about where the money\\nwent. He/she chooses someone over me. Someone uses my vulnerability against\\nme (an act of emotional treason that causes most of us to slam the entire jar to\\nthe ground rather than just dumping the marbles). All terrible betrayals,\\ndefinitely, but there is a particular sort of betrayal that is more insidious and\\nequally corrosive to trust.\\nIn fact, this betrayal usually happens long before the other ones. I’m talking\\nabout the betrayal of disengagement. Of not caring. Of letting the connection go.\\nOf not being willing to devote time and effort to the relationship. The word\\nbetrayal evokes experiences of cheating, lying, breaking a confidence, failing to\\ndefend us to someone else who’s gossiping about us, and not choosing us over\\nother people. These behaviors are certainly betrayals, but they’re not the only\\nform of betrayal. If I had to choose the form of betrayal that emerged most\\nfrequently from my research and that was the most dangerous in terms of\\ncorroding the trust connection, I would say disengagement.\\nWhen the people we love or with whom we have a deep connection stop\\ncaring, stop paying attention, stop investing, and stop fighting for the\\nrelationship, trust begins to slip away and hurt starts seeping in. Disengagement\\ntriggers shame and our greatest fears—the fears of being abandoned, unworthy,\\nand unlovable. What can make this covert betrayal so much more dangerous\\nthan something like a lie or an affair is that we can’t point to the source of our\\npain—there’s no event, no obvious evidence of brokenness. It can feel crazy-\\nmaking.\\nWe may tell a disengaged partner, “You don’t seem to care anymore,” but\\nwithout “evidence” of this, the response is “I’m home from work every night by\\nsix P.M. I tuck in the kids. I’m taking the boys to Little League. What do you want\\nfrom me?” Or at work, we think, Why am I not getting feedback? Tell me you\\nlove it! Tell me it sucks! Just tell me something so I know you remember that I\\nwork here!\\nWith children, actions speak louder than words. When we stop requesting\\ninvitations into their lives by asking about their day, asking them to tell us about\\ntheir favorite songs, wondering how their friends are doing, then children feel\\npain and fear (and not relief, despite how our teenagers may act). Because they\\ncan’t articulate how they feel about our disengagement when we stop making an\\neffort with them, they show us by acting out, thinking, This will get their\\nattention.\\nLike trust, most experiences of betrayal happen slowly, one marble at a time.\\nIn fact, the overt or “big” betrayals that I mentioned before are more likely to\\nhappen after a period of disengagement and slowly eroding trust. What I’ve\\nlearned about trust professionally and what I’ve lived personally boils down to\\nthis:\\nTrust is a product of vulnerability that grows over time and requires work,\\nattention, and full engagement. Trust isn’t a grand gesture—it’s a growing\\nmarble collection.\\nMYTH #4: WE CAN GO IT ALONE\\nGoing it alone is a value we hold in high esteem in our culture, ironically even\\nwhen it comes to cultivating connection. I get the appeal; I have that rugged\\nindividualism in my DNA. In fact, one of my very favorite break-up-kick-ass-\\nno-one-can-hurt-me songs is Whitesnake’s “Here I Go Again.” If you’re a\\nperson of a certain age, I’d put money down that you’ve rolled down the window\\nand defiantly sung: “And here I go again on my own.…Like a drifter I was born\\nto walk alone.…” If Whitesnake isn’t your cup of tea, there are bootstrapping\\nanthems in every imaginable genre. In reality, walking alone can feel miserable\\nand depressing, but we admire the strength it conveys, and going it alone is\\nrevered in our culture.\\nWell, as much as I love the idea of walking alone down a lonely street of\\ndreams, the vulnerability journey is not the kind of journey we can make alone.\\nWe need support. We need folks who will let us try on new ways of being\\nwithout judging us. We need a hand to pull us up off the ground when we get\\nkicked down in the arena (and if we live a courageous life, that will happen).\\nAcross the course of my research, participants were very clear about their need\\nfor support, encouragement, and sometimes professional help as they reengaged\\nwith vulnerability and their emotional lives. Most of us are good at giving help,\\nbut when it comes to vulnerability, we need to ask for help too.\\nIn The Gifts of Imperfection, I write, “Until we can receive with an open heart,\\nwe are never really giving with an open heart. When we attach judgment to\\nreceiving help, we knowingly or unknowingly attach judgment to giving help.”\\nWe all need help. I know I couldn’t have done it without reinforcements that\\nincluded my husband Steve, a great therapist, a stack of books a mile high, and\\nfriends and family members who were on a similar journey. Vulnerability begets\\nvulnerability; courage is contagious.\\nThere’s actually some very persuasive leadership research that supports the\\nidea that asking for support is critical, and that vulnerability and courage are\\ncontagious. In a 2011 Harvard Business Review article, Peter Fuda and Richard\\nBadham use a series of metaphors to explore how leaders spark and sustain\\nchange. One of the metaphors is the snowball. The snowball starts rolling when\\na leader is willing to be vulnerable with his or her subordinates. Their research\\nshows that this act of vulnerability is predictably perceived as courageous by\\nteam members and inspires others to follow suit.\\nSupporting the metaphor of the snowball is the story of Clynton, the managing\\ndirector of a large German corporation who realized that his directive leadership\\nstyle was preventing senior managers from taking initiative. The researchers\\nexplain, “He could have worked in private to change his behavior—but instead\\nhe stood up at an annual meeting of his top sixty managers, acknowledged his\\nfailings, and outlined both his personal and organizational roles. He admitted\\nthat he didn’t have all of the answers and asked his team for help leading the\\ncompany.” Having studied the transformation that followed this event, the\\nresearchers report that Clynton’s effectiveness surged, his team flourished, there\\nwere increases in initiative and innovation, and his organization went on to\\noutperform much larger competitors.\\nSimilar to the story above, my greatest personal and professional\\ntransformations happened when I started asking hard questions about how my\\nfear of being vulnerable was holding me back and when I found the courage to\\nshare my struggles and ask for help. After running from vulnerability, I found\\nthat learning how to lean into the discomfort of uncertainty, risk, and emotional\\nexposure was a painful process.\\nI did believe that I could opt out of feeling vulnerable, so when it happened—\\nwhen the phone rang with unimaginable news; or when I was scared; or when I\\nloved so fiercely that rather than feeling gratitude and joy I could only prepare\\nfor loss—I controlled things. I managed situations and micromanaged the people\\naround me. I performed until there was no energy left to feel. I made what was\\nuncertain certain, no matter what the cost. I stayed so busy that the truth of my\\nhurting and my fear could never catch up. I looked brave on the outside and felt\\nscared on the inside.\\nSlowly I learned that this shield was too heavy to lug around, and that the only\\nthing it really did was keep me from knowing myself and letting myself be\\nknown. The shield required that I stay small and quiet behind it so as not to draw\\nattention to my imperfections and vulnerabilities. It was exhausting.\\nI remember a very tender moment from that year, when Steve and I were lying\\non the floor watching Ellen do a series of crazy, arm-flinging, and knee-slapping\\ndances and tumbles. I looked at Steve and said, “Isn’t it funny how I just love\\nher that much more for being so vulnerable and uninhibited and goofy. I could\\nnever do that. Can you imagine knowing that you’re loved like that?” Steve\\nlooked at me and said, “I love you exactly like that.” Honestly, as someone who\\nrarely risked vulnerability and always steered clear of silly or goofy, it never\\ndawned on me that adults could love each other like that; that I could be loved\\nfor my vulnerabilities, not despite them.\\nAll of the love and support I received—especially from Steve and Diana, my\\ntherapist—allowed me to slowly begin to take more risks, to show up at work\\nand at home in new ways. I took more chances and tried new things, like\\nstorytelling. I learned how to set new boundaries and say no, even when I was\\nterrified that I was going to piss off a friend or squander a professional\\nopportunity that I’d regret. So far, I haven’t regretted a single no.\\nGoing back to Roosevelt’s “Man in the Arena” speech, I also learned that the\\npeople who love me, the people I really depend on, were never the critics who\\nwere pointing at me while I stumbled. They weren’t in the bleachers at all. They\\nwere with me in the arena. Fighting for me and with me.\\nNothing has transformed my life more than realizing that it’s a waste of time\\nto evaluate my worthiness by weighing the reaction of the people in the stands.\\nThe people who love me and will be there regardless of the outcome are within\\narm’s reach. This realization changed everything. That’s the wife and mother and\\nfriend that I now strive to be. I want our home to be a place where we can be our\\nbravest selves and our most fearful selves. Where we practice difficult\\nconversations and share our shaming moments from school and work. I want to\\nlook at Steve and my kids and say, “I’m with you. In the arena. And when we\\nfail, we’ll fail together, while daring greatly.” We simply can’t learn to be more\\nvulnerable and courageous on our own. Sometimes our first and greatest dare is\\nasking for support.\\nCHAPTER 3\\nUNDERSTANDING AND COMBATING\\nSHAME\\n(AKA, GREMLIN NINJA WARRIOR TRAINING)\\nShame derives its power from being unspeakable. That’s why it loves perfectionists—it’s so easy to keep us quiet. If we\\ncultivate enough awareness about shame to name it and speak to it, we’ve basically cut it off at the knees. Shame hates having\\nwords wrapped around it. If we speak shame, it begins to wither. Just the way exposure to light was deadly for the gremlins,\\nlanguage and story bring light to shame and destroy it.\\nVULNERABILITY AND SHAME IN ONE BOOK!\\nARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US?\\nOR\\nDEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS\\nLast year, after I had finished a talk on Wholehearted families, a man\\napproached me on the stage. He stuck out his hand and said, “I just want to say\\nthank you.” I shook his hand and offered a kind smile as he looked down at the\\nfloor. I could tell that he was fighting back tears.\\nHe took a deep breath and said, “I have to tell you that I really didn’t want to\\ncome tonight. I tried to get out of it, but my wife made me.”\\nI chuckled. “Yeah, I get that a lot.”\\n“I couldn’t understand why she was so excited. I told her that I couldn’t think\\nof a worse way to spend a Thursday night than listening to a shame researcher.\\nShe said that it was really important to her and I had to stop complaining,\\notherwise I’d ruin it for her.” He paused for a few seconds, then surprised me by\\nasking, “Are you a Harry Potter fan?”\\nI stalled for a second while I tried to connect everything he was saying. When\\nI finally gave up, I answered his question. “Yes, I am a huge fan. I’ve read all of\\nthe books several times, and I’ve watched and rewatched the movies. I’m\\nhardcore. Why?”\\nHe looked a little embarrassed before he explained, “Well, I didn’t know\\nanything about you, and as my dread built up about coming tonight, I kept\\npicturing you as Snape. I thought you’d be scary. I thought you’d be wearing all\\nblack and that you’d talk slowly and in a deep, haunting voice—like the world\\nwas ending.”\\nI laughed so hard that I almost spit out the water I was drinking. “I love\\nSnape! I’m not sure that I want to look like him, but he’s my favorite character.”\\nI immediately glanced over at my purse, which was still tucked under the bottom\\nof the podium. In it my keys were (and are) attached to my beloved LEGO\\nSnape keychain.\\nWe shared a laugh about his Snape projection, then things got more serious.\\n“What you said really made sense to me. Especially the part about us being so\\nafraid of the dark stuff. What’s the quote that you shared with the picture of the\\ntwinkle lights?”\\n“Oh, the twinkle light quote. It’s one of my favorites: ‘Only when we’re brave\\nenough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.’”\\nHe nodded. “Yes! That one! I’m sure that’s why I didn’t want to come. It’s\\ncrazy how much energy we spend trying to avoid these hard topics when they’re\\nreally the only ones that can set us free. I was shamed a lot growing up and I\\ndon’t want to do that to my three kids. I want them to know they’re enough. I\\ndon’t want them to be afraid to talk about the hard shit with us. I want them to be\\nshame resilient.”\\nAt this point we were both teary-eyed. I reached up and did that awkward “are\\nyou a hugger?” gesture, then I gave him a big ol’ hug. After we let go of our this-\\nstuff-is-hard-but-we-can-do-it embrace, he looked at me and said, “I’m pretty\\nbad at vulnerability, but I’m really good at shame. Is getting past shame\\nnecessary for getting to vulnerability?”\\n“Yes. Shame resilience is key to embracing our vulnerability. We can’t let\\nourselves be seen if we’re terrified by what people might think. Often ‘not being\\ngood at vulnerability’ means that we’re damn good at shame.”\\nAs I stumbled for better language to explain how shame stops us from being\\nvulnerable and connected, I remembered my very favorite exchange from Harry\\nPotter. “Do you remember when Harry was worried that he might be bad\\nbecause he was angry all of the time and had dark feelings?”\\nHe enthusiastically answered, “Yes! Of course! The conversation with Sirius\\nBlack! That’s the moral of the entire story.”\\n“Exactly! Sirius told Harry to listen to him very carefully, then he said,\\n‘You’re not a bad person. You’re a very good person who bad things have\\nhappened to. Besides, the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters.\\nWe’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to\\nact on. That’s who we really are.’”\\n“I get it,” he sighed.\\n“We all have shame. We all have good and bad, dark and light, inside of us.\\nBut if we don’t come to terms with our shame, our struggles, we start believing\\nthat there’s something wrong with us—that we’re bad, flawed, not good enough\\n—and even worse, we start acting on those beliefs. If we want to be fully\\nengaged, to be connected, we have to be vulnerable. In order to be vulnerable,\\nwe need to develop resilience to shame.”\\nAt this point, his wife was waiting by the stage stairs. He thanked me, gave\\nme another quick hug, and walked away. Just as he reached the bottom of the\\nstairs, he turned back and said, “You may not be Snape, but you’re a damn good\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher!”\\nIt was a conversation and a moment that I’ll never forget. On the way home\\nthat night, I thought about a line from one of the books where Harry Potter was\\ndetailing the fate of several unsuccessful Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nteachers: “One sacked, one dead, one lost his memory, and one was locked in a\\ntrunk for nine months.” I remember thinking, “Sounds about right.”\\nI won’t go on with the Harry Potter metaphor because I’m sure there’s one or\\ntwo of you out there who haven’t had the chance to read the books or see the\\nfilms, but I have to say that J. K. Rowling’s incredible imagination has made\\nteaching shame a lot easier and way more fun. The allegorical power of Harry\\nPotter lends itself to talking about everything from the struggle between light\\nand dark to the hero’s journey and why vulnerability and love are the truest\\nmarks of courage. Having spent so long trying to describe and define unnamed\\nemotions and experiences, I find that Harry Potter has given me a treasure trove\\nof characters, monsters, and images to use in my teaching. For that, I’ll be\\nforever grateful.\\nI didn’t set out to become a wild-eyed shame evangelist or a Defense Against\\nthe Dark Arts teacher, but after spending the past decade studying the corrosive\\neffect that shame has on how we live, love, parent, work, and lead, I’ve found\\nmyself practically screaming from the top of my lungs, “Yes, shame is tough to\\ntalk about. But the conversation isn’t nearly as dangerous as what we’re creating\\nwith our silence! We all experience shame. We’re all afraid to talk about it. And,\\nthe less we talk about it, the more we have it.”\\nWe have to be vulnerable if we want more courage; if we want to dare greatly.\\nBut as I told my Harry Potter friend, how can we let ourselves be seen if shame\\nhas us terrified of what people might think?\\nLet me give you an example.\\nYou’ve designed a product or written an article or created a piece of art that\\nyou want to share with a group of friends. Sharing something that you’ve created\\nis a vulnerable but essential part of engaged and Wholehearted living. It’s the\\nepitome of daring greatly. But because of how you were raised or how you\\napproach the world, you’ve knowingly or unknowingly attached your self-worth\\nto how your product or art is received. In simple terms, if they love it, you’re\\nworthy; if they don’t, you’re worthless.\\nOne of two things happens at this point in the process:\\n1. Once you realize that your self-worth is hitched to what you’ve produced or\\ncreated, it’s unlikely that you’ll share it, or if you do, you’ll strip away a\\nlayer or two of the juiciest creativity and innovation to make the revealing\\nless risky. There’s too much on the line to just put your wildest creations\\nout there.\\n2. If you do share it in its most creative form and the reception doesn’t meet\\nyour expectations, you’re crushed. Your offering is no good and you’re no\\ngood. The chances of soliciting feedback, reengaging, and going back to the\\ndrawing board are slim. You shut down. Shame tells you that you shouldn’t\\nhave even tried. Shame tells you that you’re not good enough and you\\nshould have known better.\\nIf you’re wondering what happens if you attach your self-worth to your art or\\nyour product and people love it, let me answer that from personal and\\nprofessional experience. You’re in even deeper trouble. Everything shame needs\\nto hijack and control your life is in place. You’ve handed over your self-worth to\\nwhat people think. It’s panned out a couple of times, but now it feels a lot like\\nHotel California: You can check in, but you can never leave. You’re officially a\\nprisoner of “pleasing, performing, and perfecting.”\\nWith an awareness of shame and strong shame resilience skills, this scenario\\nis completely different. You still want folks to like, respect, and even admire\\nwhat you’ve created, but your self-worth is not on the table. You know that you\\nare far more than a painting, an innovative idea, an effective pitch, a good\\nsermon, or a high Amazon.com ranking. Yes, it will be disappointing and\\ndifficult if your friends or colleagues don’t share your enthusiasm, or if things\\ndon’t go well, but this effort is about what you do, not who you are. Regardless\\nof the outcome, you’ve already dared greatly, and that’s totally aligned with your\\nvalues; with who you want to be.\\nWhen our self-worth isn’t on the line, we are far more willing to be\\ncourageous and risk sharing our raw talents and gifts. From my research with\\nfamilies, schools, and organizations, it’s clear that shame-resilient cultures\\nnurture folks who are much more open to soliciting, accepting, and incorporating\\nfeedback. These cultures also nurture engaged, tenacious people who expect to\\nhave to try and try again to get it right—people who are much more willing to\\nget innovative and creative in their efforts.\\nA sense of worthiness inspires us to be vulnerable, share openly, and\\npersevere. Shame keeps us small, resentful, and afraid. In shame-prone cultures,\\nwhere parents, leaders, and administrators consciously or unconsciously\\nencourage people to connect their self-worth to what they produce, I see\\ndisengagement, blame, gossip, stagnation, favoritism, and a total dearth of\\ncreativity and innovation.\\nPeter Sheahan is an author, speaker, and CEO of ChangeLabs™, a global\\nconsultancy building and delivering large-scale behavioral change projects for\\nclients such as Apple and IBM. Pete and I had the chance to work together last\\nsummer and I think his perspective on shame is spot on. Pete says,\\nThe secret killer of innovation is shame. You can’t measure it, but it is there. Every time someone holds back on a new\\nidea, fails to give their manager much needed feedback, and is afraid to speak up in front of a client you can be sure shame\\nplayed a part. That deep fear we all have of being wrong, of being belittled and of feeling less than, is what stops us taking the\\nvery risks required to move our companies forward.\\nIf you want a culture of creativity and innovation, where sensible risks are embraced on both a market and individual\\nlevel, start by developing the ability of managers to cultivate an openness to vulnerability in their teams. And this,\\nparadoxically perhaps, requires first that they are vulnerable themselves. This notion that the leader needs to be “in charge”\\nand to “know all the answers” is both dated and destructive. Its impact on others is the sense that they know less, and that they\\nare less than. A recipe for risk aversion if ever I have heard it. Shame becomes fear. Fear leads to risk aversion. Risk aversion\\nkills innovation.\\nThe bottom line is that daring greatly requires worthiness. Shame sends the\\ngremlins to fill our heads with completely different messages of:\\nDare not! You’re not good enough!\\nDon’t you dare get too big for your britches!\\nThe term gremlin—as we are most familiar with it—comes from Steven\\nSpielberg’s 1984 horror comedy Gremlins. Gremlins are those evil little green\\ntricksters who wreak havoc everywhere they go. They’re manipulative monsters\\nthat derive pleasure from destruction. In many circles, including my own, the\\nword gremlin has become synonymous with “shame tape.”\\nFor example, I was recently struggling to finish an article. I called a good\\nfriend to tell her about my writer’s block, and she immediately responded by\\nasking, “What are the gremlins saying?”\\nThis is a very effective way of asking about the shame tapes—the messages of\\nself-doubt and self-criticism that we carry around in our heads. My answer was\\n“There are a few of them. One’s saying that my writing sucks and that no one\\ncares about these topics. Another one’s telling me that I’m going to get criticized\\nand I’ll deserve it. And the big one keeps saying, ‘Real writers don’t struggle\\nlike this. Real writers don’t dangle their modifiers.’”\\nUnderstanding our shame tapes or gremlins is critical to overcoming shame\\nbecause we can’t always point to a certain moment or a specific put-down at the\\nhands of another person. Sometimes shame is the result of us playing the old\\nrecordings that were programmed when we were children or simply absorbed\\nfrom the culture. My good friend and colleague Robert Hilliker says, “Shame\\nstarted as a two-person experience, but as I got older I learned how to do shame\\nall by myself.” Sometimes when we dare to walk into the arena the greatest critic\\nwe face is ourselves.\\nShame derives its power from being unspeakable. That’s why it loves\\nperfectionists—it’s so easy to keep us quiet. If we cultivate enough awareness\\nabout shame to name it and speak to it, we’ve basically cut it off at the knees.\\nShame hates having words wrapped around it. If we speak shame, it begins to\\nwither. Just the way exposure to light was deadly for the gremlins, language and\\nstory bring light to shame and destroy it.\\nJust like Roosevelt advised, when we dare greatly we will err and we will\\ncome up short again and again. There will be failures and mistakes and criticism.\\nIf we want to be able to move through the difficult disappointments, the hurt\\nfeelings, and the heartbreaks that are inevitable in a fully lived life, we can’t\\nequate defeat with being unworthy of love, belonging, and joy. If we do, we’ll\\nnever show up and try again. Shame hangs out in the parking lot of the arena,\\nwaiting for us to come out defeated and determined to never take risks. It laughs\\nand says, “I told you this was a mistake. I knew you weren’t _________\\nenough.” Shame resilience is the ability to say, “This hurts. This is\\ndisappointing, maybe even devastating. But success and recognition and\\napproval are not the values that drive me. My value is courage and I was just\\ncourageous. You can move on, shame.”\\nSo, I’m not trying to kill you. I’m just saying, “We can’t embrace vulnerability\\nif shame is suffocating our sense of worthiness and connection.” Strap yourself\\nin, and let’s get our heads and hearts around this experience called shame, so we\\ncan get about the business of truly living.\\nWHAT IS SHAME AND WHY IS IT SO HARD TO\\nTALK ABOUT IT?\\n(If you’re pretty sure that shame doesn’t apply to you, keep reading; I’ll clear\\nthat up in the next couple of pages.)\\nI start every talk, article, and chapter on shame with the Shame 1-2-3s, or the\\nfirst three things that you need to know about shame, so you’ll keep listening:\\n1. We all have it. Shame is universal and one of the most primitive human\\nemotions that we experience. The only people who don’t experience shame\\nlack the capacity for empathy and human connection. Here’s your choice:\\nFess up to experiencing shame or admit that you’re a sociopath. Quick note:\\nThis is the only time that shame seems like a good option.\\n2. We’re all afraid to talk about shame.\\n3. The less we talk about shame, the more control it has over our lives.\\nThere are a couple of very helpful ways to think about shame. First, shame is\\nthe fear of disconnection. We are psychologically, emotionally, cognitively, and\\nspiritually hardwired for connection, love, and belonging. Connection, along\\nwith love and belonging (two expressions of connection), is why we are here,\\nand it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. Shame is the fear of\\ndisconnection—it’s the fear that something we’ve done or failed to do, an ideal\\nthat we’ve not lived up to, or a goal that we’ve not accomplished makes us\\nunworthy of connection. I’m not worthy or good enough for love, belonging, or\\nconnection. I’m unlovable. I don’t belong. Here’s the definition of shame that\\nemerged from my research:\\nShame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are\\nflawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging.\\nPeople often want to believe that shame is reserved for people who have\\nsurvived an unspeakable trauma, but this is not true. Shame is something we all\\nexperience. And while it feels as if shame hides in our darkest corners, it actually\\ntends to lurk in all of the familiar places. Twelve “shame categories” have\\nemerged from my research:\\nAppearance and body image\\nMoney and work\\nMotherhood/fatherhood\\nFamily\\nParenting\\nMental and physical health\\nAddiction\\nSex\\nAging\\nReligion\\nSurviving trauma\\nBeing stereotyped or labeled\\nHere are some of the responses we received when we asked people for an\\nexample of shame:\\nShame is getting laid off and having to tell my pregnant wife.\\nShame is having someone ask me, “When are you due?” when I’m not\\npregnant.\\nShame is hiding the fact that I’m in recovery.\\nShame is raging at my kids.\\nShame is bankruptcy.\\nShame is my boss calling me an idiot in front of the client.\\nShame is not making partner.\\nShame is my husband leaving me for my next-door neighbor.\\nShame is my wife asking me for a divorce and telling me that she wants\\nchildren, but not with me.\\nShame is my DUI.\\nShame is infertility.\\nShame is telling my fiancé that my dad lives in France when in fact he’s in\\nprison.\\nShame is Internet porn.\\nShame is flunking out of school. Twice.\\nShame is hearing my parents fight through the walls and wondering if I’m\\nthe only one who feels this afraid.\\nShame is real pain. The importance of social acceptance and connection is\\nreinforced by our brain chemistry, and the pain that results from social rejection\\nand disconnection is real pain. In a 2011 study funded by the National Institute\\nof Mental Health and by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, researchers found\\nthat, as far as the brain is concerned, physical pain and intense experiences of\\nsocial rejection hurt in the same way. So when I define shame as an intensely\\n“painful” experience, I’m not kidding. Neuroscience advances confirm what\\nwe’ve known all along: Emotions can hurt and cause pain. And just as we often\\nstruggle to define physical pain, describing emotional pain is difficult. Shame is\\nparticularly hard because it hates having words wrapped around it. It hates being\\nspoken.\\nUNTANGLING SHAME, GUILT, HUMILIATION,\\nAND EMBARRASSMENT\\nIn fact, as we work to understand shame, one of the simpler reasons that shame\\nis so difficult to talk about is vocabulary. We often use the terms embarrassment,\\nguilt, humiliation, and shame interchangeably. It might seem overly picky to\\nstress the importance of using the appropriate term to describe an experience or\\nemotion; however, it is much more than semantics.\\nHow we experience these different emotions comes down to self-talk. How do\\nwe talk to ourselves about what’s happening? The best place to start examining\\nself-talk and untangling these four distinct emotions is with shame and guilt. The\\nmajority of shame researchers and clinicians agree that the difference between\\nshame and guilt is best understood as the difference between “I am bad” and “I\\ndid something bad.”\\nGuilt = I did something bad.\\nShame = I am bad.\\nFor example, let’s say that you forgot that you made plans to meet a friend at\\nnoon for lunch. At 12:15 P.M., your friend calls from the restaurant to make sure\\nyou’re okay. If your self-talk is “I’m such an idiot. I’m a terrible friend and a\\ntotal loser”—that’s shame. If, on the other hand, your self-talk is “I can’t believe\\nI did that. What a crappy thing to do”—that’s guilt.\\nHere’s what’s interesting—especially for those who automatically think, You\\nshould feel like a terrible friend! or A little shame will help you keep your act\\ntogether next time. When we feel shame, we are most likely to protect ourselves\\nby blaming something or someone, rationalizing our lapse, offering a\\ndisingenuous apology, or hiding out. Rather than apologizing, we blame our\\nfriend and rationalize forgetting: “I told you I was really busy. This wasn’t a\\ngood day for me.” Or we apologize halfheartedly and think to ourselves,\\nWhatever. If she knew how busy I am, she’d be apologizing. Or we see who is\\ncalling and don’t answer the phone at all, and then when we finally can’t stop\\ndodging our friend, we lie: “Didn’t you get my e-mail? I canceled in the\\nmorning. You should check your spam folder.”\\nWhen we apologize for something we’ve done, make amends, or change a\\nbehavior that doesn’t align with our values, guilt—not shame—is most often the\\ndriving force. We feel guilty when we hold up something we’ve done or failed to\\ndo against our values and find they don’t match up. It’s an uncomfortable\\nfeeling, but one that’s helpful. The psychological discomfort, something similar\\nto cognitive dissonance, is what motivates meaningful change. Guilt is just as\\npowerful as shame, but its influence is positive, while shame’s is destructive. In\\nfact, in my research I found that shame corrodes the very part of us that believes\\nwe can change and do better.\\nWe live in a world where most people still subscribe to the belief that shame is\\na good tool for keeping people in line. Not only is this wrong, but it’s dangerous.\\nShame is highly correlated with addiction, violence, aggression, depression,\\neating disorders, and bullying. Researchers don’t find shame correlated with\\npositive outcomes at all—there are no data to support that shame is a helpful\\ncompass for good behavior. In fact, shame is much more likely to be the cause of\\ndestructive and hurtful behaviors than it is to be the solution.\\nAgain, it is human nature to want to feel worthy of love and belonging. When\\nwe experience shame, we feel disconnected and desperate for worthiness. When\\nwe’re hurting, either full of shame or even just feeling the fear of shame, we are\\nmore likely to engage in self-destructive behaviors and to attack or shame others.\\nIn the chapters on parenting, leadership, and education, we’ll explore how shame\\nerodes our courage and fuels disengagement, and what we can do to cultivate\\ncultures of worthiness, vulnerability, and shame resilience.\\nHumiliation is another word that we often confuse with shame. Donald Klein\\ncaptures the difference between shame and humiliation when he writes, “People\\nbelieve they deserve their shame; they do not believe they deserve their\\nhumiliation.” If John is in a meeting with his colleagues and his boss, and his\\nboss calls him a loser because of his inability to close a sale, John will probably\\nexperience that as either shame or humiliation.\\nIf John’s self-talk is “God, I am a loser. I’m a failure”—that’s shame. If his\\nself-talk is “Man, my boss is so out of control. This is ridiculous. I don’t deserve\\nthis”—that’s humiliation. Humiliation feels terrible and makes for a miserable\\nwork or home environment—and if it’s ongoing, it can certainly become shame\\nif we start to buy into the messaging. It is, however, still better than shame.\\nRather than internalizing the “loser” comment, John’s saying to himself, “This\\nisn’t about me.” When we do that, it’s less likely that we’ll shut down, act out, or\\nfight back. We stay aligned with our values while trying to solve the problem.\\nEmbarrassment is the least serious of the four emotions. It’s normally fleeting\\nand it can eventually be funny. The hallmark of embarrassment is that when we\\ndo something embarrassing, we don’t feel alone. We know other folks have done\\nthe same thing and, like a blush, it will pass rather than define us.\\nGetting familiar with the language is an important start to understanding\\nshame. It is part of the first element of what I call shame resilience.\\nI GET IT. SHAME IS BAD. SO WHAT DO WE DO\\nABOUT IT?\\nThe answer is shame resilience. Note that shame resistance is not possible. As\\nlong as we care about connection, the fear of disconnection will always be a\\npowerful force in our lives, and the pain caused by shame will always be real.\\nBut here’s the great news. In all my studies, I’ve found that men and women\\nwith high levels of shame resilience have four things in common—I call them\\nthe elements of shame resilience. Learning to put these elements into action is\\nwhat I call “Gremlin Ninja Warrior training.”\\nWe’ll go through each of the four elements, but first I want to explain what I\\nmean by shame resilience. I mean the ability to practice authenticity when we\\nexperience shame, to move through the experience without sacrificing our\\nvalues, and to come out on the other side of the shame experience with more\\ncourage, compassion, and connection than we had going into it. Shame resilience\\nis about moving from shame to empathy—the real antidote to shame.\\nIf we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and\\nunderstanding, shame can’t survive. Self-compassion is also critically important,\\nbut because shame is a social concept—it happens between people—it also heals\\nbest between people. A social wound needs a social balm, and empathy is that\\nbalm. Self-compassion is key because when we’re able to be gentle with\\nourselves in the midst of shame, we’re more likely to reach out, connect, and\\nexperience empathy.\\nTo get to empathy, we have to first know what we’re dealing with. Here are\\nthe four elements of shame resilience—the steps don’t always happen in this\\norder, but they always ultimately lead us to empathy and healing:\\n1. Recognizing Shame and Understanding Its Triggers. Shame is biology\\nand biography. Can you physically recognize when you’re in the grips of\\nshame, feel your way through it, and figure out what messages and\\nexpectations triggered it?\\n2. Practicing Critical Awareness. Can you reality-check the messages and\\nexpectations that are driving your shame? Are they realistic? Attainable?\\nAre they what you want to be or what you think others need/want from\\nyou?\\n3. Reaching Out. Are you owning and sharing your story? We can’t\\nexperience empathy if we’re not connecting.\\n4. Speaking Shame. Are you talking about how you feel and asking for what\\nyou need when you feel shame?\\nShame resilience is a strategy for protecting connection—our connection with\\nourselves and our connections with the people we care about. But resilience\\nrequires cognition, or thinking, and that’s where shame has a huge advantage.\\nWhen shame descends, we almost always are hijacked by the limbic system. In\\nother words, the prefrontal cortex, where we do all of our thinking and analyzing\\nand strategizing, gives way to that primitive fight-or-flight part of our brain.\\nIn his book Incognito, neuroscientist David Eagleman describes the brain as a\\n“team of rivals.” He writes, “There is an ongoing conversation among the\\ndifferent factions in your brain, each competing to control the single output\\nchannel of your behavior.” He lays out the dominant two-party system of reason\\nand emotion: “The rational system is the one that cares about analysis of things\\nin the outside world, while the emotional system monitors the internal state and\\nworries whether things are good or bad.” Eagleman makes the case that because\\nboth parties are battling to control one output—behavior—emotions can tip the\\nbalance of decision making. I would say that’s definitely true when the emotion\\nis shame.\\nOur fight or flight strategies are effective for survival, not for reasoning or\\nconnection. And the pain of shame is enough to trigger that survival part of our\\nbrain that runs, hides, or comes out swinging. In fact, when I asked the research\\nparticipants how they normally responded to shame before they started working\\non shame resilience, I heard many comments like these:\\n“When I feel shame, I’m like a crazy person. I do stuff and say stuff I would\\nnormally never do or say.”\\n“Sometimes I just wish I could make other people feel as bad as I do. I just\\nwant to lash out and scream at everyone.”\\n“I get desperate when I feel shame. Like I have nowhere to turn—no one to\\ntalk to.”\\n“When I feel ashamed, I check out mentally and emotionally. Even with my\\nfamily.”\\n“Shame makes you feel estranged from the world. I hide.”\\n“One time I stopped to get gas and my credit card was declined. The guy\\ngave me a really hard time. As I pulled out of the station, my three-year-old\\nson started crying. I just started screaming, ‘Shut up…shut up…shut up!’ I\\nwas so ashamed about my card. I went nuts. Then I was ashamed that I\\nyelled at my son.”\\nWhen it comes to understanding how we defend ourselves against shame, I\\nturn to the wonderful research from the Stone Center at Wellesley. Dr. Linda\\nHartling, a former relational-cultural theorist at the Stone Center and now the\\ndirector of Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies, uses the late Karen\\nHorney’s work on “moving toward, moving against, and moving away” to\\noutline the strategies of disconnection we use to deal with shame.\\nAccording to Dr. Hartling, in order to deal with shame, some of us move away\\nby withdrawing, hiding, silencing ourselves, and keeping secrets. Some of us\\nmove toward by seeking to appease and please. And some of us move against by\\ntrying to gain power over others, by being aggressive, and by using shame to\\nfight shame (like sending really mean e-mails). Most of us use all of these—at\\ndifferent times with different folks for different reasons. Yet all of these\\nstrategies move us away from connection—they are strategies for disconnecting\\nfrom the pain of shame.\\nHere’s a story about one of my own shame experiences that brings life to all\\nof these concepts. It’s not one of my best moments, but it’s a good example of\\nwhy it’s important to cultivate and practice shame resilience if we don’t want to\\nheap even more shame on top of a painful situation.\\nFirst, let me start with a little backstory. Turning down speaking invitations is\\na vulnerable process for me. Years of pleasing and perfecting have left me\\nfeeling less than comfortable with disappointing people—the “good girl” in me\\nhates letting people down. The gremlins whisper, “They’ll think you’re\\nungrateful” and “Don’t be selfish.” I also struggle with the fear that if I say no\\neveryone is going to stop asking. This is when the gremlins say, “You want more\\ntime to rest? Be careful what you wish for—this work that you love could all go\\naway.”\\nMy new commitment to setting boundaries comes from the twelve years I’ve\\nspent studying Wholeheartedness and what it takes to make the journey from\\n“What will people think?” to “I am enough.” The most connected and\\ncompassionate people of those I’ve interviewed set and respect boundaries. I\\ndon’t just want to research and travel all of the time talking about being\\nWholehearted; I want to live it. That means that I turn down about 80 percent of\\nthe speaking requests that I receive. I say yes when it works with my family\\ncalendar, my research commitments, and my life.\\nWell, last year I received an e-mail from a man who was really angry with me\\nbecause I wasn’t able to speak at an event that he was hosting. I turned down the\\ninvitation because it conflicted with a family birthday. The e-mail was mean-\\nspirited and jam-packed with personal attacks. My gremlins were having a field\\nday!\\nRather than replying, I decided to forward it to my husband along with a little\\nnote telling him exactly what I thought about this guy and his e-mail. I needed to\\ndischarge my shame and anger. Trust me, it was not “good girl” e-mail. I can\\nneither confirm nor deny using the word horseshit. Twice.\\nI hit Reply instead of Forward.\\nThe second my Mac laptop made the airplane swooshing sound that it makes\\nwhen you hit the Send button, I screamed, “Come back! Please come back!” I\\nwas still staring at the screen, totally immobilized by shame layered on shame,\\nwhen the man fired back a response along the lines of “Aha! I knew it! You are a\\nhorrible person. You’re not Wholehearted. You suck.”\\nThe shame attack was already in full swing. My mouth was dry, time was\\nslowing down, and I was seeing tunnel vision. I struggled to swallow as the\\ngremlins started whispering: “You do suck!” “How could you be so stupid?”\\nThey always know exactly what to say. As soon as I could catch my breath, I\\nstarted murmuring, “Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain…”\\nThis strategy is the brainchild of Caroline, a woman whom I interviewed early\\nin my research and then a couple of years later, after she had been practicing\\nshame resilience. Caroline told me that whenever she felt shame, she’d\\nimmediately start repeating the word pain aloud. “Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain,\\npain.” She told me, “I’m sure it sounds crazy, and I probably look like a nut, but\\nfor some reason it really works.”\\nOf course it works! It’s a brilliant way to get out of lizard-brain survival mode\\nand pull that prefrontal cortex back online. After one or two minutes of “pain”\\nchanting, I took a deep breath and tried to focus myself. I thought, “Okay. Shame\\nattack. I’m okay. What’s next? I can do this.”\\nI recognized the physical symptoms which allowed me to reboot my thinking\\nbrain and remember the three ninja-warrior gremlin moves that are the most\\neffective path to shame resilience for me. And fortunately I’ve been practicing\\nthese moves long enough to know that they are totally counterintuitive and I\\nhave to trust the process:\\n1. Practice courage and reach out! Yes, I want to hide, but the way to fight\\nshame and to honor who we are is by sharing our experience with someone\\nwho has earned the right to hear it—someone who loves us, not despite our\\nvulnerabilities, but because of them.\\n2. Talk to myself the way I would talk to someone I really love and whom I’m\\ntrying to comfort in the midst of a meltdown: You’re okay. You’re human—\\nwe all make mistakes. I’ve got your back. Normally during a shame attack\\nwe talk to ourselves in ways we would NEVER talk to people we love and\\nrespect.\\n3. Own the story! Don’t bury it and let it fester or define me. I often say this\\naloud: “If you own this story you get to write the ending. If you own this\\nstory you get to write the ending.” When we bury the story we forever stay\\nthe subject of the story. If we own the story we get to narrate the ending. As\\nCarl Jung said, “I am not what has happened to me. I am what I choose to\\nbecome.”\\nEven though I knew that the most dangerous thing to do after a shaming\\nexperience is to hide or bury our story, I was afraid to make the call. But I did.\\nI called both my husband, Steve, and my good friend Karen. They gave me\\nwhat I needed the most: empathy, the best reminder that we’re not alone. Rather\\nthan judgment (which exacerbates shame), empathy conveys a simple\\nacknowledgment, “You’re not alone.”\\nEmpathy is connection; it’s a ladder out of the shame hole. Not only did Steve\\nand Karen help me climb out by listening and loving me, but they made\\nthemselves vulnerable by sharing that they, too, had spent some time in the same\\nhole. Empathy doesn’t require that we have the exact same experiences as the\\nperson sharing their story with us. Neither Karen nor Steve had sent an e-mail\\nlike that, but they were both intimately familiar with the imposter gremlins and\\nthe “getting caught” feeling and the “Oh, shit!” experience. Empathy is\\nconnecting with the emotion that someone is experiencing, not the event or the\\ncircumstance. Shame dissipated the minute I realized that I wasn’t alone—that\\nmy experience was human.\\nInterestingly, Steve and Karen’s responses were totally different. Steve was\\nmore serious and more “Oh, man. I know that feeling!” Karen took an approach\\nthat had me laughing in about thirty seconds. What the responses shared in\\ncommon was the power of “me too.” Empathy is a strange and powerful thing.\\nThere is no script. There is no right way or wrong way to do it. It’s simply\\nlistening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and\\ncommunicating that incredibly healing message of “You’re not alone.”\\nMy conversations with Steve and Karen allowed me to move through shame,\\nget back on my emotional feet, and respond to the man’s “I knew it!” e-mail\\nfrom a place of authenticity and self-worth. I owned my part in the angry\\nexchange and apologized for my inappropriate language. I also set clear\\nboundaries around future communications. I never heard from him again.\\nShame thrives on secret keeping, and when it comes to secrets, there’s some\\nserious science behind the twelve-step program saying, “You’re only as sick as\\nyour secrets.” In a pioneering study, psychologist and University of Texas\\nprofessor James Pennebaker and his colleagues studied what happened when\\ntrauma survivors—specifically rape and incest survivors—kept their experiences\\nsecret. The research team found that the act of not discussing a traumatic event\\nor confiding it to another person could be more damaging than the actual event.\\nConversely, when people shared their stories and experiences, their physical\\nhealth improved, their doctor’s visits decreased, and they showed significant\\ndecreases in their stress hormones.\\nSince his early work on the effects of secret keeping, Pennebaker has focused\\nmuch of his research on the healing power of expressive writing. In his book\\nWriting to Heal, Pennebaker writes, “Since the mid-1980s an increasing number\\nof studies have focused on the value of expressive writing as a way to bring\\nabout healing. The evidence is mounting that the act of writing about traumatic\\nexperience for as little as fifteen or twenty minutes a day for three or four days\\ncan produce measurable changes in physical and mental health. Emotional\\nwriting can also affect people’s sleep habits, work efficiency, and how they\\nconnect with others.”\\nShame resilience is a practice and like Pennebaker, I think writing about our\\nshame experiences is an incredibly powerful component of the practice. It takes\\ntime to cultivate that practice and courage to reach out and talk about hard\\nthings. If you’re reading this and thinking, I’d like to be able to have these\\nconversations with my partner or my friend or my child—do it! If you’re reading\\nit and thinking, Shame has become a management style around here, and it’s no\\nwonder that folks are disengaged—we should talk about this—do it! You don’t\\nneed to figure it out first or master the information before you engage in\\nconversation. You just have to say, “I’ve been reading a book and there’s a\\nchapter about shame. I’d love to talk about it with you. If I lend you my book,\\nwill you take a look?”\\nThe next section is about men, women, shame, and worthiness. I think you’ll\\nwant to lend them this chapter as well. What I learned about men and shame\\nchanged my life.\\nWEBS AND BOXES: HOW MEN AND WOMEN\\nEXPERIENCE SHAME DIFFERENTLY\\nFor the first four years of my study on shame, I focused solely on women. At\\nthat time many researchers believed, and some today still believe, that men and\\nwomen’s experiences of shame are different. I was concerned that if I combined\\nthe data from men and women, I’d miss some of the important nuances of their\\nexperiences. That I opted to just interview women, I confess, was partially due to\\nmy mind-set that when it came to worthiness, women were the ones struggling.\\nAt some level, I also think my resistance was based on an intuitive sense that\\ninterviewing men would be like stumbling into a new and strange world.\\nAs it turns out, it was definitely a strange new world—a world of unspoken\\nhurt. I got a glimpse into that world in 2005 at the end of one of my lectures. A\\ntall, thin man who I’d guess was in his early sixties followed his wife to the front\\nof the room. He was wearing a yellow Izod golf sweater—an image I’ll never\\nforget. I spoke with his wife for a few minutes as I signed a stack of books that\\nshe’d bought for herself and her daughters. As she started to walk away, her\\nhusband turned to her and said, “I’ll be right there—give me a minute.”\\nShe clearly didn’t want him to stay and talk to me. She tried coaxing him with\\na couple of “C’mons,” but he didn’t budge. I, of course, was thinking, Go with\\nher, dude. You’re scaring me. After a few unsuccessful attempts, she walked\\ntoward the back of the room, and he turned to face me at my book-signing table.\\nIt started innocently enough. “I like what you have to say about shame,” he\\ntold me. “It’s interesting.”\\nI thanked him and waited—I could tell there was more coming.\\nHe leaned in closer and asked, “I’m curious. What about men and shame?\\nWhat have you learned about us?”\\nI felt instant relief. This wasn’t going to take long because I didn’t know\\nmuch. I explained, “I haven’t done many interviews with men. I just study\\nwomen.”\\nHe nodded and said, “Well. That’s convenient.”\\nI felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up in defense. I forced a smile and\\nasked, “Why convenient?” in the very high voice that I use when I’m\\nuncomfortable. He replied by asking me if I really wanted to know. I told him\\nyes, which was a half-truth. I was on my guard.\\nThen his eyes welled up with tears. He said, “We have shame. Deep shame.\\nBut when we reach out and share our stories, we get the emotional shit beat out\\nof us.” I struggled to maintain eye contact with him. His raw pain had touched\\nme, but I was still trying to protect myself. Just as I was about to make a\\ncomment about how hard men are on each other, he said, “Before you say\\nanything about those mean coaches, bosses, brothers, and fathers being the only\\nones…” He pointed toward the back of the room where his wife was standing\\nand said, “My wife and daughters—the ones you signed all of those books for—\\nthey’d rather see me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall off. You\\nsay you want us to be vulnerable and real, but c’mon. You can’t stand it. It\\nmakes you sick to see us like that.”\\nHolding my breath, I had this very visceral reaction to what he was saying. It\\nhit me the way only truth can. He let out a long sigh, and as quickly as he had\\nbegun, he said, “That’s all I wanted to say. Thanks for listening.” Then he just\\nwalked away.\\nI had spent years researching women and hearing their stories of struggle. In\\nthat moment, I realized that men have their own stories and that if we’re going to\\nfind our way out of shame, it will be together. So, this section is about what I’ve\\nlearned about women, men, how we hurt each other, and how we need each\\nother to heal.\\nWhat I’ve come to believe about men and women now that I’ve studied both\\nis that men and women are equally affected by shame. The messages and\\nexpectations that fuel shame are most definitely organized by gender, but the\\nexperience of shame is universal and deeply human.\\nWOMEN AND THE SHAME WEB\\nWhen I asked women to share their definitions or experiences of shame, here’s\\nwhat I heard:\\nLook perfect. Do perfect. Be perfect. Anything less than that is shaming.\\nBeing judged by other mothers.\\nBeing exposed—the flawed parts of yourself that you want to hide from\\neveryone are revealed.\\nNo matter what I achieve or how far I’ve come, where I come from and\\nwhat I’ve survived will always keep me from feeling like I’m good enough.\\nEven though everyone knows that there’s no way to do it all, everyone still\\nexpects it. Shame is when you can’t pull off looking like it’s under control.\\nNever enough at home. Never enough at work. Never enough in bed. Never\\nenough with my parents. Shame is never enough.\\nNo seat at the cool table. The pretty girls are laughing.\\nIf you recall the twelve shame categories (appearance and body image, money\\nand work, motherhood/fatherhood, family, parenting, mental and physical health,\\naddiction, sex, aging, religion, surviving trauma, and being stereotyped or\\nlabeled), the primary trigger for women, in terms of its power and universality, is\\nthe first one: how we look. Still. After all of the consciousness-raising and\\ncritical awareness, we still feel the most shame about not being thin, young, and\\nbeautiful enough.\\nInterestingly, in terms of shame triggers for women, motherhood is a close\\nsecond. And (bonus!) you don’t have to be a mother to experience mother\\nshame. Society views womanhood and motherhood as inextricably bound;\\ntherefore our value as women is often determined by where we are in relation to\\nour roles as mothers or potential mothers. Women are constantly asked why they\\nhaven’t married or, if they’re married, why they haven’t had children. Even\\nwomen who are married and have one child are often asked why they haven’t\\nhad a second child. You’ve had your kids too far apart? “What were you\\nthinking?” Too close? “Why? That’s so unfair to the kids.” If you’re working\\noutside the home, the first question is “What about the children?” If you’re not\\nworking, the first question is “What kind of example are you setting for your\\ndaughters?” Mother shame is ubiquitous—it’s a birthright for girls and women.\\nBut the real struggle for women—what amplifies shame regardless of the\\ncategory—is that we’re expected (and sometimes desire) to be perfect, yet we’re\\nnot allowed to look as if we’re working for it. We want it to just materialize\\nsomehow. Everything should be effortless. The expectation is to be natural\\nbeauties, natural mothers, natural leaders, and naturally good parents, and we\\nwant to belong to naturally fabulous families. Think about how much money has\\nbeen made selling products that promise “the natural look.” And when it comes\\nto work, we love to hear, “She makes it look so easy,” or “She’s a natural.”\\nAs I found myself reading through the pages of definitions and examples\\nprovided by women I kept envisioning a web. What I saw was a sticky, complex\\nspiderweb of layered, conflicting, and competing expectations that dictate\\nexactly:\\nwho we should be\\nwhat we should be\\nhow we should be\\nWhen I think of my own efforts to be everything to everyone—something that\\nwomen are socialized to do—I can see how every move I make just ensnares me\\neven more. Every effort to twist my way out of the web just leads to becoming\\nmore stuck. That’s because every choice has consequences or leads to someone\\nbeing disappointed.\\nThe web is a metaphor for the classic double-bind situation. Writer Marilyn\\nFrye describes a double bind as “a situation in which options are very limited\\nand all of them expose us to penalty, censure, or deprivation.” If you take\\ncompeting and conflicting expectations (which are often unattainable from the\\nget-go) you have this:\\nBe perfect, but don’t make a fuss about it and don’t take time away from\\nanything, like your family or your partner or your work, to achieve your\\nperfection. If you’re really good, perfection should be easy.\\nDon’t upset anyone or hurt anyone’s feelings, but say what’s on your mind.\\nDial the sexuality way up (after the kids are down, the dog is walked, and\\nthe house is clean), but dial it way down at the PTO meeting. And, geez,\\nwhatever you do, don’t confuse the two—you know how we talk about\\nthose PTO sexpots.\\nJust be yourself, but not if it means being shy or unsure. There’s nothing\\nsexier than self-confidence (especially if you’re young and smokin’ hot).\\nDon’t make people feel uncomfortable, but be honest.\\nDon’t get too emotional, but don’t be too detached either. Too emotional\\nand you’re hysterical. Too detached and you’re a coldhearted bitch.\\nIn a US study on conformity to feminine norms, researchers recently listed the\\nmost important attributes associated with “being feminine” as being nice,\\npursuing a thin body ideal, showing modesty by not calling attention to one’s\\ntalents or abilities, being domestic, caring for children, investing in a romantic\\nrelationship, keeping sexual intimacy contained within one committed\\nrelationship, and using our resources to invest in our appearance.\\nBasically, we have to be willing to stay as small, sweet, and quiet as possible,\\nand use our time and talent to look pretty. Our dreams, ambitions, and gifts are\\nunimportant. God forbid that some young girl who has the cure for cancer tucked\\naway in her abilities finds this list and decides to follow the rules. If she does,\\nwe’ll never know her genius—and I feel sure of that. Why? Because every\\nsuccessful woman whom I’ve interviewed has talked to me about the sometimes\\ndaily struggle to push past “the rules” so she can assert herself, advocate for her\\nideas, and feel comfortable with her power and gifts.\\nEven to me the issue of “stay small, sweet, quiet, and modest” sounds like an\\noutdated problem, but the truth is that women still run into those demands\\nwhenever we find and use our voices. When the TEDxHouston video went viral,\\nI wanted to hide. I begged my husband, Steve, to hack into the TED website and\\n“bring the entire thing down!” I fantasized about breaking into the offices where\\nthey were keeping the video and stealing it. I was desperate. That was when I\\nrealized that I had unconsciously worked throughout my career to keep my work\\nsmall. I loved writing for my community of readers, because preaching to the\\nchoir is easy and relatively safe. The quick and global spread of my work was\\nexactly what I had always tried to avoid. I didn’t want the exposure, and I was\\nterrified of the mean-spirited criticism that’s so rampant in Internet culture.\\nWell, the mean-spiritedness happened, and the vast majority of it was directed\\nto reinforcing those norms that we’d love to believe are outdated. When a news\\noutlet shared the video on their site, a heated debate erupted in the comments\\nsection of their website about (of course!) my weight. “How can she talk about\\nworthiness when she clearly needs to lose fifteen pounds?” On another site, a\\ndebate grew about the appropriateness of mothers having breakdowns. “I feel\\nsorry for her children. Good mothers don’t fall apart.” Another commenter\\nwrote, “Less research. More Botox.”\\nSomething similar happened when I wrote an article on imperfection for\\nCNN.com. To accompany the article, the editor used a photo I had taken of a\\ngood friend who had “I am Enough” written across the top of her chest. It’s a\\nbeautiful photo that I have hanging in my study as a reminder. Well, that fueled\\ncomments like “She may believe that she’s enough, but by the look of that chest,\\nshe could use some more,” and “If I looked like Brené Brown, I’d embrace\\nimperfection too.”\\nI know that these examples are symptomatic of the cruelty culture that we live\\nin today and that everyone is fair game, but think about how and what they chose\\nto attack. They went after my appearance and my mothering—two kill shots\\ntaken straight from the list of feminine norms. They didn’t go after my intellect\\nor my arguments. That wouldn’t hurt enough.\\nSo, no, those societal norms aren’t outdated, even if they’re reductionist and\\nsqueeze the life out of us, and shame is the route to enforcing them. Which is\\nanother reminder of why shame resilience is a prerequisite for vulnerability. I\\nbelieve I dared greatly in my TEDxHouston talk. Talking about my struggles\\nwas a courageous thing for me to do, given my drive to self-protect and use\\nresearch as armor. And the only reason I’m still standing (and sitting here\\nwriting this book) is because I’ve cultivated some pretty fierce shame resilience\\nskills and I’m crystal clear that courage is an important value to me.\\nI clearly saw that these comments triggered shame in me and I could quickly\\nreality-check the messages. Yes, they still hurt. Yes, I was pissed. Yes, I cried my\\neyes out. Yes, I wanted to disappear. But I gave myself permission to feel these\\nthings for a couple of hours or days, then I reached out, talked through my\\nfeelings with people I trust and love, and I moved on. I felt more courageous,\\nmore compassionate, more connected. (I also stopped reading anonymous\\ncomments. If you’re not in the arena with the rest of us, fighting and getting your\\nass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in your feedback.)\\nHOW MEN EXPERIENCE SHAME\\nWhen I asked men to define shame or give me an answer, here’s what I heard:\\nShame is failure. At work. On the football field. In your marriage. In bed.\\nWith money. With your children. It doesn’t matter—shame is failure.\\nShame is being wrong. Not doing it wrong, but being wrong.\\nShame is a sense of being defective.\\nShame happens when people think you’re soft. It’s degrading and shaming\\nto be seen as anything but tough.\\nRevealing any weakness is shaming. Basically, shame is weakness.\\nShowing fear is shameful. You can’t show fear. You can’t be afraid—no\\nmatter what.\\nShame is being seen as “the guy you can shove up against the lockers.”\\nOur worst fear is being criticized or ridiculed—either one of these is\\nextremely shaming.\\nBasically, men live under the pressure of one unrelenting message: Do not be\\nperceived as weak.\\nWhenever my graduate students were going to do interviews with men, I told\\nthem to prepare for three things: high school stories, sports metaphors, and the\\nword pussy. If you’re thinking that you can’t believe I just wrote that, I get it. It’s\\none of my least favorite words. But as a researcher, I know it’s important to be\\nhonest about what emerged, and that word came up all of the time in the\\ninterviews. It didn’t matter if the man was eighteen or eighty, if I asked, “What’s\\nthe shame message?” the answer was “Don’t be a pussy.”\\nWhen I first started writing about my work with men, I used the image of a\\nbox—something that looked like a shipping crate—to explain how shame traps\\nmen. Like the demands on women to be naturally beautiful, thin, and perfect at\\neverything, especially motherhood, the box has rules that tell men what they\\nshould and shouldn’t do, and who they’re allowed to be. But for men, every rule\\ncomes back to the same mandate: “Don’t be weak.”\\nI’ll never forget when a twenty-year-old man who was part of a small group of\\ncollege students that I was interviewing said, “Let me show you the box.” I knew\\nhe was a tall guy, but when he stood up, it was clear that he was at least six foot\\nfour. He said, “Imagine living like this,” as he crouched down and pretended that\\nhe was stuffed inside a small box.\\nStill hunched over, he said, “You really only have three choices. You spend\\nyour life fighting to get out, throwing punches at the side of the box and hoping\\nit will break. You always feel angry and you’re always swinging. Or you just\\ngive up. You don’t give a shit about anything.” At that point he slumped over on\\nthe ground. You could have heard a pin drop in the room.\\nThen he stood up, shook his head, and said, “Or you stay high so you don’t\\nreally notice how unbearable it is. That’s the easiest way.” The students grabbed\\non to stay high like a life preserver and broke into nervous laughter. This\\nhappens a lot when you’re talking about shame or vulnerability—anything to cut\\nthe tension.\\nBut this brave young man wasn’t laughing and neither was I. His\\ndemonstration was one of the most honest and courageous things I’ve ever had\\nthe privilege of seeing, and I know that the people in that room were deeply\\naffected by it. After the group interview, he told me about his experiences\\ngrowing up. He had been a passionate artist as a child, and he winced as he\\ndescribed how he was sure from an early age that he’d be happy if he could\\nspend his life painting and drawing. He said that one day he was in the kitchen\\nwith his dad and uncle. His uncle pointed to a collection of his art that was\\nplastered on the refrigerator and said jokingly to his father, “What? You’re\\nraising a faggot artist now?”\\nAfter that, he said, his father, who had always been neutral about his art,\\nforbade him from taking classes. Even his mother, who had always been so\\nproud of his talent, agreed that it was “a little too girly.” He told me that he’d\\ndrawn a picture of his house the day before all of this happened, and to that day\\nit was the last thing he’d ever drawn. That night I wept for him and for all of us\\nwho never got to see his work. I think about him all of the time and hope he has\\nreconnected with his art. I know it’s a tremendous loss for him, and I’m equally\\npositive that the world is missing out.\\nPAY NO ATTENTION TO THAT MAN BEHIND\\nTHE CURTAIN\\nAs I’ve learned more about men and their experiences with shame, I still see that\\nimage of a shipping crate with a big stamp across it that reads, “CAUTION: Do\\nNot Be Perceived as Weak.” I see how boys are issued a crate when they’re born.\\nIt’s not too crowded when they’re toddlers. They’re still small and can move\\naround a bit. They can cry and hold on to mamma, but as they grow older,\\nthere’s less and less wiggle room. By the time they’re grown men, it’s\\nsuffocating.\\nBut just as with women, men are caught in their own double bind. Over the\\npast couple of years, especially since the economic downturn, what I have\\nstarted to see is the box from The Wizard of Oz. I’m talking about the small,\\ncurtain-concealed box that the wizard stands in as he’s controlling his\\nmechanical “great and powerful” Oz image. As scarcity has grabbed hold of our\\nculture, it’s not just “Don’t be perceived as weak,” but also “You better be great\\nand all powerful.” This image first came to mind when I interviewed a man who\\nwas in deep shame about getting “downsized.” He told me, “It’s funny. My\\nfather knows. My two closest friends know. But my wife doesn’t know. It’s been\\nsix months, and every morning I still get dressed and leave the house like I’m\\ngoing to work. I drive across town, sit in coffee shops, and look for a job.”\\nI’m a skilled interviewer, but I can imagine that the look on my face conveyed\\nsomething like “How on earth did you pull that off?” Without waiting for my\\nnext question, he answered, “She doesn’t want to know. If she already knows,\\nshe wants me to keep pretending. Trust me, if I find another job and tell her after\\nI’m back at work, she’ll be grateful. Knowing would change the way she feels\\nabout me. She didn’t sign up for this.”\\nI was not prepared to hear over and over from men how the women—the\\nmothers, sisters, girlfriends, wives—in their lives are constantly criticizing them\\nfor not being open and vulnerable and intimate, all the while they are standing in\\nfront of that cramped wizard closet where their men are huddled inside,\\nadjusting the curtain and making sure no one sees in and no one gets out. There\\nwas a moment when I was driving home from an interview with a small group of\\nmen and thought, Holy shit. I am the patriarchy.\\nHere’s the painful pattern that emerged from my research with men: We ask\\nthem to be vulnerable, we beg them to let us in, and we plead with them to tell us\\nwhen they’re afraid, but the truth is that most women can’t stomach it. In those\\nmoments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear and\\nthat fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust. And men are\\nvery smart. They know the risks, and they see the look in our eyes when we’re\\nthinking, C’mon! Pull it together. Man up. As Joe Reynolds, one of my mentors\\nand the dean at our church, once told me during a conversation about men,\\nshame, and vulnerability, “Men know what women really want. They want us to\\npretend to be vulnerable. We get really good at pretending.”\\nCovert shame hurts just as much as overt shame. Take, for example, the man\\nwho told me that he was always feeling shame with his wife around money. He\\nsaid the latest instance was when his wife came home and said, “I just saw\\nKatie’s new house! It’s amazing. She’s so happy to finally get that dream house.\\nOn top of that, she’s going to quit working next year.”\\nHe told me his immediate response was rage. So he picked a fight with his\\nwife about her mother coming to visit, and then quickly disappeared to another\\npart of the house. As we were talking about this conversation, he said, “It was\\nshame. Why did she have to say that? I get it. Katie’s husband makes a lot of\\nmoney. He takes better care of her. I can’t compete.”\\nWhen I asked him if he thought that it was her intention to hurt him or shame\\nhim, he responded, “I’m not sure. Who knows? I turned down a job that paid a\\nlot more but required traveling three weeks out of the month. She said she was\\nsupportive, and that she and the kids would miss me too much, but now she\\nmakes little comments about money all of the time. I have no idea what to\\nthink.”\\nPISSED OFF OR SHUT DOWN\\nI don’t want to oversimplify something as complex as the response to shame, but\\nI have to say that when it comes to men, there seem to be two primary responses:\\npissed off or shut down. Of course, like women, as men develop shame\\nresilience, this changes, and men learn to respond to shame with awareness, self-\\ncompassion, and empathy. But without that awareness, when men feel that rush\\nof inadequacy and smallness, they normally respond with anger and/or by\\ncompletely turning off.\\nOnce I had collected enough interviews to start seeing strong patterns and\\nthemes, I scheduled interviews with several male therapists who specialize in\\nmen’s issues. I wanted to make sure that I wasn’t filtering what I heard from the\\nmen through my own experiences. When I asked one of these therapists about\\nthe concept of “pissed off or shut down,” he told me this story to illustrate the\\npoint.\\nWhen he was a freshman in high school, he tried out and made the football\\nteam. On the first day of practice, his coach told the boys to line up on the line of\\nscrimmage. The therapist had grown up playing a lot of football in his\\nneighborhood, but this was his first experience on a field, in full pads, across\\nfrom boys whose goal was to flatten him. He said, “I was suddenly afraid. I was\\nthinking about how much it was going to hurt, and I guess that fear showed up\\non my face.”\\nHe said his coach yelled his last name and said, “Don’t be a pussy! Get on the\\nline.” He said he immediately felt shame coursing through his body. “In that\\nsingle moment, I became very clear about how the world works and what it\\nmeans to be a man:\\n“I am not allowed to be afraid.\\n“I am not allowed to show fear.\\n“I am not allowed to be vulnerable.\\n“Shame is being afraid, showing fear, or being vulnerable.”\\nWhen I asked him what he did next, he looked me in the eye and said, “I\\nturned my fear into rage and steamrolled over the guy in front of me. It worked\\nso well that I spent the next twenty years turning my fear and vulnerability into\\nrage and steamrolling anyone who was across from me. My wife. My children.\\nMy employees. There was no other way out from underneath the fear and\\nshame.”\\nI heard such grief and clarity in his voice as he was saying this to me. It made\\ntotal sense. Fear and vulnerability are powerful emotions. You can’t just wish\\nthem away. You have to do something with them. Many men, in fact, use very\\nphysiological descriptions when they talk to me about “pissed off or shut down.”\\nIt’s almost as if shame, criticism, and ridicule are physically intolerable.\\nThe therapist concluded, “I got into therapy when my rage and my drinking\\nwere no longer manageable. When it started costing me my marriage and my\\nrelationships with my children. That’s why I do the work I do today.”\\nShame resilience—the four elements we discussed in the previous chapter—is\\nabout finding a middle path, an option that allows us to stay engaged and to find\\nthe emotional courage we need to respond in a way that aligns with our values.\\nI’M ONLY AS HARD ON OTHERS AS I AM ON\\nMYSELF\\nJust like the father coming down on his budding artist son or the coach giving\\nhis player a hard time, women can also be very hard on other women. We are\\nhard on others because we’re hard on ourselves. That’s exactly how judgment\\nworks. Finding someone to put down, judge, or criticize becomes a way to get\\nout of the web or call attention away from our box. If you’re doing worse than I\\nam at something, I think, my chances of surviving are better.\\nSteve and I met lifeguarding and coaching swimming. The big rule in\\nlifeguarding is to utilize any means possible before you actually jump in and try\\nto pull someone out of the water. Even though you’re a strong swimmer and the\\nperson you’re trying to help is half your size, a desperate person will do anything\\nto save themselves—to grab a breath—including drowning you in their effort to\\nsurvive. The same is true for women and the shame web. We’re so desperate to\\nget out and stay out of shame that we’re constantly serving up the people around\\nus as more deserving prey.\\nWhat’s ironic (or perhaps natural) is that research tells us that we judge people\\nin areas where we’re vulnerable to shame, especially picking folks who are\\ndoing worse than we’re doing. If I feel good about my parenting, I have no\\ninterest in judging other people’s choices. If I feel good about my body, I don’t\\ngo around making fun of other people’s weight or appearance. We’re hard on\\neach other because we’re using each other as a launching pad out of our own\\nperceived shaming deficiency. It’s hurtful and ineffective, and if you look at the\\nmean-girl culture in middle schools and high schools, it’s also contagious. We’ve\\nhanded this counterfeit survival mechanism down to our children.\\nIn my interviews with teachers and school administrators, two patterns\\nemerged that speak directly to this issue. The first pattern reported by faculty and\\nprincipals was that often the children who are engaging in the bullying behaviors\\nor vying for social ranking by putting down others have parents who engage in\\nthe same behaviors. When it came to girls, the phrase that kept emerging from\\nthe interviews was “The parents aren’t upset by their daughters’ behaviors;\\nthey’re proud of them for being popular.” One school administrator likened this\\nbehavior to the fathers who first ask, “Well, did he at least win the fight?”\\nThe other pattern, which has only emerged in the last couple of years, is the\\nage of the children when this starts happening. When I started this work,\\nbullying wasn’t a hot topic, but as a shame researcher, I was aware that it was a\\ngrowing trend. In fact, I wrote an op-ed on bullying and reality television for the\\nHouston Chronicle over ten years ago. Back then my focus was teenagers\\nbecause the data pointed to adolescence as the prime age range for these\\nbehaviors. In the past couple of years, I’m hearing about girls and boys as young\\nas first grade engaging in these behaviors.\\nHow do we break this insidious pattern? Maybe by deciding (and showing our\\nchildren) that the solution to being stuck in shame is not to denigrate others stuck\\njust like us, but to join hands and pull free together. For example, if we’re at the\\ngrocery store, and we push our cart past another mother whose child is\\nscreaming bloody murder and throwing Cheerios on the floor, we have a choice.\\nIf we choose to use the moment to confirm that we’re better than she is, and that\\nshe’s stuck in the web in ways we are not, we will roll our eyes in disapproval\\nand walk by. Our other choice, though, is to flash that mother our best “you’re\\nnot alone—I’ve been there, sister” smile because we know what she’s feeling.\\nYes, empathy requires some vulnerability, and we risk getting back a “mind your\\nown damn business” look, but it’s worth it. It doesn’t just loosen up the web for\\nher. It loosens it up for us the next time it’s our child and our Cheerios—and you\\ncan bet it will be.\\nWhat gives me hope about our willingness to extend a hand back and support\\neach other is the increasing number of men and women I encounter who are\\nwilling to risk vulnerability and share their stories of shame resilience. I see this\\nin formal and informal mentoring programs. I see this from folks who are\\nwriting blogs and sharing their experiences with readers. I see it in schools and\\nprograms that not only are becoming increasingly less tolerant of student\\nbullying but are holding teachers, administrators, and parents accountable for\\ntheir behaviors. Adults are being asked to model the Wholeheartedness that they\\nwant to see in the children.\\nThere is a quiet transformation happening that is moving us from “turning on\\neach other” to “turning toward each other.” Without question, that transformation\\nwill require shame resilience. If we’re willing to dare greatly and risk\\nvulnerability with each other, worthiness has the power to set us free.\\nIT’S NOT ABOUT THE BACK FAT:\\nMEN, WOMEN, SEX, AND BODY IMAGE\\nIn 2006 I met with twenty-two community college students, male and female, to\\ntalk about shame. It was my first coed large group interview. At some point, a\\nyoung man in his early twenties explained how he had recently divorced his wife\\nafter coming back from serving in the military and finding out that she was\\nhaving an affair. He said he wasn’t surprised because he never felt “good enough\\nfor her.” He explained that he constantly asked her what she needed and wanted,\\nand that every time he got close to meeting her needs, she “moved the goalpost\\nanother ten feet.”\\nA young woman in the class spoke up and said, “Guys are the same way.\\nThey’re never satisfied either. We’re never pretty, sexy, or skinny enough.”\\nWithin seconds a conversation broke out about body image and sex. The\\ndiscussion was mostly about how it’s so scary to have sex with someone you\\ncare about when you’re worried about how your body looks. The young women\\nwho started the conversation said, “It’s not easy to have sex and keep your\\nstomach sucked in. How can we get into it when we’re worried about our back\\nfat?”\\nThe young man who had shared the story of his divorce slammed his hand\\ndown on his desk and shouted, “It’s not about the back fat! You’re worried about\\nit. We’re not. We don’t give a shit!” The class fell completely quiet. He took a\\ncouple of deep breaths and said, “Stop making up all of this stuff about what\\nwe’re thinking! What we’re really thinking is ‘Do you love me? Do you care\\nabout me? Do you want me? Am I important to you? Am I good enough?’ That’s\\nwhat we’re thinking. When it comes to sex, it feels like our life is on the line,\\nand you’re worried about that crap?”\\nAt that point, half of the young men in the room were so emotional that they\\nhad their faces in their hands. A few girls were in tears, and I couldn’t breathe.\\nThe young woman who had brought up the body image issue said, “I don’t\\nunderstand. My last boyfriend was always criticizing my body.”\\nThe young vet who had just brought us all to our knees replied, “That’s\\nbecause he’s an asshole. It’s not because he’s a guy. Some of us are just guys.\\nGive us a break. Please.”\\nA middle-aged man in the group joined in, staring straight down at his desk.\\n“It’s true. When you want to be with us…in that way…it makes us feel more\\nworthy. We stand a little taller. Believe in ourselves more. I don’t know why, but\\nit’s true. And I’ve been married since I was eighteen. It still feels that way with\\nmy wife.”\\nNever in my life before that moment did I think about men feeling vulnerable\\nabout sex. Never did I consider that their self-worth was in any way on the line. I\\ndidn’t understand. So I interviewed many more men about the topic of sexuality,\\nshame, and worthiness, including mental health professionals. In one of my final\\ninterviews on the topic, I sat down with a therapist who had spent more than\\ntwenty-five years working with men. He explained that from the time boys are\\neight to ten years old, they learn that initiating sex is their responsibility and that\\nsexual rejection soon becomes the hallmark of masculine shame.\\nHe explained, “Even in my own life, when my wife isn’t interested, I still have\\nto battle feelings of shame. It doesn’t matter if I intellectually understand why\\nshe’s not in the mood. I’m vulnerable and it’s very difficult.” When I asked him\\nabout his work around addiction and pornography, he gave me an answer that\\nhelped me understand that issue in an entirely new light. He said, “For five\\nbucks and five minutes, you think you’re getting what you need, and you don’t\\nhave to risk rejection.”\\nThe reason that response was so revelatory to me was because it was so utterly\\ndifferent from what women felt. After interviewing women for a decade, it was\\nclear that women see the issue of men and pornography as having to do with\\ntheir own inadequate appearance and/or their lack of sexual expertise. At the end\\nof my interview with this wonderful and wise man, he said, “I guess the secret is\\nthat sex is terrifying for most men. That’s why you see everything from porn to\\nthe violent, desperate attempts to exercise power and control. Rejection is deeply\\npainful.”\\nCultivating intimacy—physical or emotional—is almost impossible when our\\nshame triggers meet head-on and create the perfect shame storm. Sometimes\\nthese shame storms are directly about sex and intimacy, but often there are\\noutlying gremlins wreaking havoc in our relationships. Common issues include\\nbody image, aging, appearance, money, parenting, motherhood, exhaustion,\\nresentment, and fear. When I asked men, women, and couples how they\\npracticed Wholeheartedness around these very sensitive and personal issues, one\\nanswer came up again and again: honest, loving conversations that require major\\nvulnerability. We have to be able to talk about how we feel, what we need and\\ndesire, and we have to be able to listen with an open heart and an open mind.\\nThere is no intimacy without vulnerability. Yet another powerful example of\\nvulnerability as courage.\\nTHE WORDS WE CAN NEVER TAKE BACK\\nToo close for missiles, I’m switching to guns.\\n—Top Gun\\nWhen I talk to couples, I can see how shame creates one of the dynamics most\\nlethal to a relationship. Women, who feel shame when they don’t feel heard or\\nvalidated, often resort to pushing and provoking with criticism (“Why don’t you\\never do enough?” or “You never get it right”). Men, in turn, who feel shame\\nwhen they feel criticized for being inadequate, either shut down (leading women\\nto poke and provoke more) or come back with anger.\\nFor the first few years of our marriage, Steve and I fell into this pattern. I\\nremember one argument when we were both angry beyond belief. After ten\\nminutes of endless chiding on my part, he turned to me and said, “Leave me\\nalone for twenty minutes. I’m done. I won’t do this anymore.” When he shut and\\nlocked the door, I got so mad that I actually banged on the door and said, “Get\\nback out here and fight with me.” In that moment, when I heard myself, I saw\\nwhat was happening. He was on the verge of shutting down or raging, and I was\\nfeeling unheard and misunderstood. The result was mutual desperation.\\nSteve and I are heading into our eighteenth year of marriage, and this year\\nwe’ll celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of our first date. He is, without\\nquestion, the best thing that’s ever happened to me. When we got married,\\nneither one of us had any idea what a good partnership looked like or what it\\ntook to make it work. If you asked us today what we believe is the key to our\\nrelationship, the answer would be vulnerability, love, humor, respect, shame-free\\nfighting, and blame-free living. We learned some of that on our own through\\ngood ol’ trial and error, but we also learned from my work and the research\\nparticipants who were brave enough to share their stories with me. I’m so\\ngrateful to them.\\nI think we can all agree that feeling shame is an incredibly painful experience.\\nWhat we often don’t realize is that perpetrating shame is equally as painful, and\\nno one does that with the precision of a partner or a parent. These are the people\\nwho know us the best and who bear witness to our vulnerabilities and fears.\\nThankfully, we can apologize for shaming someone we love, but the truth is that\\nthose shaming comments leave marks. And shaming someone we love around\\nvulnerability is the most serious of all security breaches. Even if we apologize,\\nwe’ve done serious damage because we’ve demonstrated our willingness to use\\nsacred information as a weapon.\\nIn The Gifts of Imperfection, I share the definition of love that I developed\\nbased on my data. Here it is:\\nWe cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we\\nhonor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness, and affection.\\nLove is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and grow, a connection that can only be cultivated\\nbetween two people when it exists within each one of them—we can only love others as much as we love ourselves.\\nShame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows. Love can\\nonly survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed, and rare.\\nDeveloping this definition was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.\\nProfessionally, it just seemed arrogant to try to define something as big and\\nimportant as love. It felt like an endeavor best left to the poets and artists. My\\nmotivation was not to “nail it,” but to start a conversation about what we need\\nand want from love. I don’t care if I’m wrong, but let’s talk about love. Let’s\\nhave some conversations about the experience that gives meaning to our lives.\\nPersonally, I fought the data with everything I have. Over and over, I heard the\\nidea of self-love as a prerequisite to loving others, and I hated it. Sometimes it’s\\nso much easier to love Steve and the kids than it is to love myself. It’s so much\\neasier to accept their quirks and eccentricities than it is to practice self-love\\naround what I see as my deep flaws. But in practicing self-love over the past\\ncouple of years, I can say that it has immeasurably deepened my relationships\\nwith the people I love. It’s given me the courage to show up and be vulnerable in\\nnew ways, and that’s what love is all about.\\nAs we think about shame and love, the most pressing question is this: Are we\\npracticing love? Yes, most of us are really good at professing it—sometimes ten\\ntimes a day. But are we walking the talk? Are we being our most vulnerable\\nselves? Are we showing trust, kindness, affection, and respect to our partners?\\nIt’s not the lack of professing that gets us in trouble in our relationships; it’s\\nfailing to practice love that leads to hurt.\\nBECOMING REAL\\nDo you remember how I mentioned earlier in the chapter that researchers found\\nthat attributes such as nice, thin, and modest were qualities that our culture\\nassociates with femininity? Well, when looking at the attributes associated with\\nmasculinity in the US, the same researchers identified the following: winning,\\nemotional control, risk-taking, violence, dominance, playboy, self-reliance,\\nprimacy of work, power over women, disdain for homosexuality, and pursuit of\\nstatus.\\nUnderstanding these lists and what they mean is critically important to\\nunderstanding shame and cultivating resilience. As I explained in the beginning\\nof the chapter, shame is universal, but the messages and expectations that drive\\nshame are organized by gender. These feminine and masculine norms are the\\nfoundation of shame triggers, and here’s why: If women want to play by the\\nrules, they need to be sweet, thin, and pretty, stay quiet, be perfect moms and\\nwives, and not own their power. One move outside of these expectations and\\nBAM! The shame web closes in. Men, on the other hand, need to stop feeling,\\nstart earning, put everyone in their place, and climb their way to the top or die\\ntrying. Push open the lid of your box to grab a breath of air, or slide that curtain\\nback a bit to see what’s going on, and BAM! Shame cuts you down to size.\\nI think it’s important to add that for men there’s also a cultural message that\\npromotes homophobic cruelty. If you want to be masculine in our culture, it’s not\\nenough to be straight— you must also show an outward disgust toward the gay\\ncommunity. The idea of “do this or dislike these people if you want to be\\naccepted into our group” emerged as a major shame setup in the research.\\nIt doesn’t matter if the group is a church or a gang or a sewing circle or\\nmasculinity itself, asking members to dislike, disown, or distance themselves\\nfrom another group of people as a condition of “belonging” is always about\\ncontrol and power. I think we have to question the intentions of any group that\\ninsists on disdain toward other people as a membership requirement. It may be\\ndisguised as belonging, but real belonging doesn’t necessitate disdain.\\nWhen I look at those eleven attributes of masculinity, that’s not the kind of\\nman I want to spend my life with and that’s not how I want to raise my son. The\\nword that comes to my mind when I think about a life built around those\\nqualities is lonely. The picture in my mind goes back to the Wizard of Oz. He’s\\nnot a real person with human needs, but a “great and powerful” projection of\\nwhat a man is supposed to be. Lonely, exhausting, and soul-sucking.\\nWhen I talk to men and women with high levels of shame resilience, they are\\nkeenly aware of these lists. They keep those strictures in mind so that when\\nshame starts creeping up on them, or they find themselves fully in shame, they\\ncan reality-check these “norms,” thus practicing the second element of shame\\nresilience—critical awareness. Basically, they can choose consciously not to play\\nalong.\\nThe man in shame says, “I’m not supposed to get emotional when I have to\\nlay off these people.”\\nThe man practicing shame resilience responds, “I’m not buying into this\\nmessage. I’ve worked with these guys for five years. I know their families. I’m\\nallowed to care about them.”\\nShame whispers in the ear of the woman who’s out of town on business,\\n“You’re not a good mother because you’re going to miss your son’s class play.”\\nShe replies, “I hear you, but I’m not playing that tape today. My mothering is\\nway bigger than one class performance. You can leave now.”\\nOne of the most powerful ways that our shame triggers get reinforced is when\\nwe enter into a social contract based on these gender straitjackets. Our\\nrelationships are defined by women and men saying, “I’ll play my role, and you\\nplay yours.” One of the patterns revealed in the research was how all that role\\nplaying becomes almost unbearable around midlife. Men feel increasingly\\ndisconnected, and the fear of failure becomes paralyzing. Women are exhausted,\\nand for the first time they begin to clearly see that the expectations are\\nimpossible. The accomplishments, accolades, and acquisitions that are a\\nseductive part of living by this contract start to feel like a Faustian bargain.\\nRemembering that shame is the fear of disconnection—the fear that we’re\\nunlovable and don’t belong—makes it easy to see why so many people in\\nmidlife overfocus on their children’s lives, work sixty hours a week, or turn to\\naffairs, addiction, and disengagement. We start to unravel. The expectations and\\nmessages that fuel shame keep us from fully realizing who we are as people.\\nToday, I look back and feel so grateful to women and men who have shared\\ntheir stories with me. I’m thankful for the people who were brave enough to say,\\n“These are my secrets and my fears, here’s how they brought me to my knees,\\nand here’s how I learned to stand in my worthiness again.” I’m also indebted to\\nthe man in the yellow Izod sweater. His vulnerability and honesty set in motion\\nwork that has forever changed my career and, more importantly, my life.\\nAs I look back on what I’ve learned about shame, gender, and worthiness, the\\ngreatest lesson is this: If we’re going to find our way out of shame and back to\\neach other, vulnerability is the path and courage is the light. To set down those\\nlists of what we’re supposed to be is brave. To love ourselves and support each\\nother in the process of becoming real is perhaps the greatest single act of daring\\ngreatly.\\nI’ll leave you with this passage from the 1922 children’s classic The Velveteen\\nRabbit by Margery Williams. My friend DeeDee Parker Wright sent it to me last\\nyear with a note that said, “This is what being Wholehearted is all about.” I\\nagree. It’s a beautiful reminder of how much easier it is to become real when we\\nknow we’re loved:\\n“Real isn’t how you are made,” said the Skin Horse. “It’s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long,\\nlong time, not just to play with, but really loves you, then you become Real.”\\n“Does it hurt?” asked the Rabbit.\\n“Sometimes,” said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. “When you are Real, you don’t mind being hurt.”\\n“Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,” he asked, “or bit by bit?”\\n“It doesn’t happen all at once,” said the Skin Horse. “You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t often happen\\nto people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of\\nyour hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out, and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t\\nmatter at all, because once you are Real, you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.”\\nCHAPTER 4\\nTHE VULNERABILITY\\nARMORY\\nAs children we found ways to protect ourselves from vulnerability, from being hurt, diminished, and disappointed. We put on\\narmor; we used our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors as weapons; and we learned how to make ourselves scarce, even to\\ndisappear. Now as adults we realize that to live with courage, purpose, and connection—to be the person whom we long to be\\n—we must again be vulnerable. We must take off the armor, put down the weapons, show up, and let ourselves be seen.\\nTHE word persona is the Greek term for “stage mask.” In my work masks\\nand armor are perfect metaphors for how we protect ourselves from the\\ndiscomfort of vulnerability. Masks make us feel safer even when they become\\nsuffocating. Armor makes us feel stronger even when we grow weary from\\ndragging the extra weight around. The irony is that when we’re standing across\\nfrom someone who is hidden or shielded by masks and armor, we feel frustrated\\nand disconnected. That’s the paradox here: Vulnerability is the last thing I want\\nyou to see in me, but the first thing I look for in you.\\nIf I were directing a play about the vulnerability armory, the setting would be\\na middle school cafeteria and the characters would be our eleven-, twelve-, and\\nthirteen-year-old selves. I pick this age because armor can be hard to see on\\nadults. Once we’ve worn it long enough, it molds to our shape and is ultimately\\nundetectable—it’s like a second skin. Masks are the same way. I’ve interviewed\\nhundreds of participants who have conveyed the same fear: “I can’t take the\\nmask off now—no one knows what I really look like. Not my partner, not my\\nkids, not my friends. They’ve never met the real me. I’m not even sure who I am\\nunder here.”\\nPreteens or tweens, though, are much different. Upper elementary school and\\nmiddle school was where most of us started to try on new and different forms of\\nprotection. At this tender age, the armor is still awkward and ill fitting. Kids are\\nclumsy in their efforts to hide fear and self-doubt, which makes it easier for\\nobservers to see exactly what armor they are using and why. And depending on\\nthe level of shame and fear, most kids have yet to be convinced that the\\nheaviness of the armor or the suffocating nature of a mask is worth the effort.\\nThey put on and take off personas and protection without hesitation, sometimes\\nin the same sentence: “I don’t care what those people think. They’re so stupid.\\nThe dance is stupid. Can you call their moms and find out what they’re wearing?\\nI hope I get to dance.”\\nThe after-school specials of my youth seemed to be dedicated to exploring just\\nthese ideas. They brought us the mean boy who really just wanted to be included\\nand the know-it-all girl who was showing off at school to hide her misery over\\nher parents’ recent divorce. Our protection mechanisms may be more\\nsophisticated now that we’re adults, but most of us learned about armor during\\nthese raw and impressionable years, and most of us can be brought back to that\\nplace in a heartbeat.\\nFrom my personal experiences, I can tell you that the most difficult thing\\nabout parenting a daughter in middle school is coming face-to-face with the\\nawkward, sweaty-palmed seventh-grader who lives inside me. My instinct back\\nthen was to duck and run, and I often feel that impulse creeping up on me when\\nEllen is in a struggle. I swear there are times when she’s describing a situation at\\nschool that I can actually smell my middle school cafeteria.\\nWhether we’re fourteen or fifty-four, our armor and our masks are as\\nindividualized and unique as the personal vulnerability, discomfort, and pain\\nwe’re trying to minimize. That’s why I was surprised to discover that we all\\nshare a small array of common protection mechanisms. Our armor may be\\ncustom-made, but certain parts of it are interchangeable. By prying open the\\ndoors of the armory, we can expose to daylight the more universal bits and\\npieces and also rummage through the closets that house less universal, but often\\ndangerous, items of vulnerability protection.\\nIf you’re like me, it’s tempting to take this information and create your own\\nafter-school special. As these shared mechanisms started to emerge from the\\ndata, my first instinct was to label behavior and cast the people around me as\\nstereotypes: “She so wears this mask, and my neighbor totally uses this armor.”\\nIt’s human nature to want to categorize and oversimplify, but I think this misses\\nthe point. None of us uses just one of these shared defenses. Most of us will be\\nable to relate to almost all of them, depending on the different circumstances we\\nnavigate. My hope is that a peek inside the armory will help us to look inside\\nourselves. How do we protect ourselves? When and how did we start using these\\ndefense mechanisms? What would it take to make us put the armor away?\\nTHE “ENOUGH” MANDATE\\nFor me the most powerful part of this research was discovering the strategies\\nthat seem to empower people to take off the masks and armor that I’m about to\\ndescribe. I assumed that I’d find unique strategies for each protection\\nmechanism, similar to what emerged in the ten guideposts I write about in The\\nGifts of Imperfection. But that wasn’t the case here.\\nIn the first chapter, I talked about “enough” as the opposite of scarcity, and the\\nproperties of scarcity as shame, comparison, and disengagement. Well, it appears\\nthat believing that we’re “enough” is the way out of the armor—it gives us\\npermission to take off the mask. With that sense of “enough” comes an embrace\\nof worthiness, boundaries, and engagement. This lay at the core of every strategy\\nilluminated by the research participants for freeing themselves from their armor:\\nI am enough (worthiness versus shame).\\nI’ve had enough (boundaries versus one-uping and comparison).\\nShowing up, taking risks, and letting myself be seen is enough (engagement\\nversus disengagement).\\nAs you read through this chapter, I think it’s helpful for you to know that\\nevery single person I interviewed spoke about struggling with vulnerability. It’s\\nnot as if there are lucky people among us who can openly embrace vulnerability\\nwithout reservation, hesitation, or fear. When it comes to uncertainty, risk, and\\nemotional exposure, what I heard over and over were descriptions of people\\ntrying on some kind of armor before finally letting it go:\\n“My first instinct is to ____________, but that never worked, so now I\\n_______________, and that’s changed my life.”\\n“I \\nspent \\nyears \\n___________________ \\nuntil \\none \\nday \\nI \\ntried\\n________________, and it made my marriage stronger.”\\nLast year I gave a talk on vulnerability to 350 SWAT team officers, parole\\nofficers, and jailers. (Yes, it was as intimidating as it sounds.) A SWAT officer\\nwalked up to me after the talk and said, “The only reason we listened to you is\\nbecause you’re just as bad at being open as we are. If you didn’t wrestle with\\nbeing vulnerable, we wouldn’t trust you one bit.”\\nNot only did I believe him, but I totally agreed. I trust the strategies that I’m\\nwriting about here for two reasons. First, the research participants who shared\\nthem with me had wrestled with the same gremlins, discomfort, and self-doubt\\nthat we all face. Second, I’ve practiced these strategies in my own life and know\\nfor a fact that they aren’t just game changers—they’re lifesavers.\\nThe three forms of shielding that I am about to introduce are what I refer to as\\nthe “common vulnerability arsenal” because I have found that we all incorporate\\nthem into our personal armor in some way. These include foreboding joy, or the\\nparadoxical dread that clamps down on momentary joyfulness; perfectionism,\\nor believing that doing everything perfectly means you’ll never feel shame; and\\nnumbing, the embrace of whatever deadens the pain of discomfort and pain.\\nEach shield is followed by “Daring Greatly” strategies, all variants on “being\\nenough” that have proved to be effective at disarming the three common forms\\nof shielding.\\nTHE COMMON VULNERABILITY SHIELDS\\nTHE SHIELD: FOREBODING JOY\\nGiven that I study emotions like shame, fear, and vulnerability, I hardly expected\\nto one day be telling you that exploring the construct of joy turned my\\nprofessional and personal life upside down. But it’s true. In fact, having spent\\nseveral years studying what it means to feel joyful, I’d argue that joy is probably\\nthe most difficult emotion to really feel. Why? Because when we lose the ability\\nor willingness to be vulnerable, joy becomes something we approach with deep\\nforeboding. This shift from our younger self’s greeting of joy with unalloyed\\ndelight happens slowly and outside of our awareness. We don’t seem to even\\nknow that it’s happening or why. We just know that we crave more joy in our\\nlives, that we are joy starved.\\nIn a culture of deep scarcity—of never feeling safe, certain, and sure enough\\n—joy can feel like a setup. We wake up in the morning and think, Work is going\\nwell. Everyone in the family is healthy. No major crises are happening. The\\nhouse is still standing. I’m working out and feeling good. Oh, shit. This is bad.\\nThis is really bad. Disaster must be lurking right around the corner.\\nOr we get promoted, and our first thought is Too good to be true. What’s the\\ncatch? We find out we’re pregnant, and we think, Our daughter is healthy and\\nhappy, so something really bad is going to happen with this baby. I just know it.\\nWe’re taking our first family vacation, but rather than being excited, we’re\\nmaking plans for the plane to go down or the ship to sink.\\nWe’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop. That expression originated in\\nthe early 1900s, when new immigrants and people flooding to the cities were\\ncrammed into tenement housing where you could literally hear your upstairs\\nneighbor taking off his shoes at night. Once you heard the first shoe hit the floor\\nyou waited for the other shoe to drop. Even though the world today is much\\nsafer in many ways than it was in the early part of that century, and our life\\nexpectancy is far greater than that of the folks who were listening for a second\\nshoe to hit the floor, the stakes feel so much higher to us. Most of us today think\\nof the other shoe as something terrifying: a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an\\nE. coli outbreak in our local grocery store, a school shooting.\\nWhen I started asking participants about the experiences that left them feeling\\nthe most vulnerable, I didn’t expect joy to be one of the answers. I expected fear\\nand shame, but not the joyful moments of their lives. I was shocked to hear\\npeople say they were at their most vulnerable when:\\nStanding over my children while they’re sleeping\\nAcknowledging how much I love my husband/wife\\nKnowing how good I’ve got it\\nLoving my job\\nSpending time with my parents\\nWatching my parents with my children\\nThinking about my relationship with my boyfriend\\nGetting engaged\\nGoing into remission\\nHaving a baby\\nGetting promoted\\nBeing happy\\nFalling in love\\nNot only was I shocked to hear these answers, I knew I was in trouble.\\nBefore my 2007 breakdown spiritual awakening, foreboding joy was one of\\nmy own unconscious pieces of armor. When I first made the connection between\\nvulnerability and joy reported by participants, I could barely breathe. I had\\nconsidered my constant disaster planning as my little secret. I was convinced\\nthat I was the only one who stood over my children while they slept and, in the\\nsplit second that I became engulfed with love and adoration, pictured something\\nreally terrible happening to them. I was sure that no one but me pictured car\\nwrecks and rehearsed the horrific phone conversations with the police that all of\\nus dread.\\nOne of the first stories I heard was from a woman in her late forties. “I used to\\ntake every good thing and imagine the worst possible disaster,” she told me. “I\\nwould literally picture the worst-case scenario and try to control all of the\\noutcomes. When my daughter got into the college of her dreams, I just knew\\nsomething bad would happen if she moved too far away. I spent the entire\\nsummer before she left trying to convince her to go to a local school. It crushed\\nher confidence and took the fun out of our last summer. It was a painful lesson.\\nNow I cross my fingers, stay grateful, pray, and try like hell to push the bad\\nimages out of my head. Unfortunately, I’ve passed that way of thinking down to\\nmy daughter. She’s increasingly afraid to try new things, especially when her life\\nis going well. She says she doesn’t want to ‘tempt fate.’”\\nA man in his early sixties told me, “I used to think the best way to go through\\nlife was to expect the worst. That way, if it happened, you were prepared, and if\\nit didn’t happen, you were pleasantly surprised. Then I was in a car accident and\\nmy wife was killed. Needless to say, expecting the worst didn’t prepare me at all.\\nAnd worse, I still grieve for all of those wonderful moments we shared and that I\\ndidn’t fully enjoy. My commitment to her is to fully enjoy every moment now. I\\njust wish she was here, now that I know how to do that.”\\nThese stories illustrate how the concept of foreboding joy as a method of\\nminimizing vulnerability is best understood as a continuum that runs from\\n“rehearsing tragedy” to what I call “perpetual disappointment.” Some of us, like\\nthe woman in the first story, scramble to the bleakest worst-case scenario when\\njoy rears its vulnerable head, while others never even see joy, preferring to stay\\nin an unmoving state of perpetual disappointment. What the perpetual-\\ndisappointment folks described is this: “It’s easier to live disappointed than it is\\nto feel disappointed. It feels more vulnerable to dip in and out of disappointment\\nthan to just set up camp there. You sacrifice joy, but you suffer less pain.”\\nBoth of these ends of the continuum tell the same story: Softening into the\\njoyful moments of our lives requires vulnerability. If, like me, you’ve ever stood\\nover your children and thought to yourself, I love you so much I can barely\\nbreathe, and in that exact moment have been flooded with images of something\\nterrible happening to your child, know that you’re not crazy nor are you alone.\\nAbout eighty percent of the parents I’ve interviewed acknowledged having that\\nexperience. The same percentage holds true for the thousands of parents I’ve\\nspoken to and worked with over the years. Why? What are we doing and why on\\nearth are we doing it?\\nOnce we make the connection between vulnerability and joy, the answer is\\npretty straightforward: We’re trying to beat vulnerability to the punch. We don’t\\nwant to be blindsided by hurt. We don’t want to be caught off-guard, so we\\nliterally practice being devastated or never move from self-elected\\ndisappointment.\\nFor those of us who rehearse tragedy, there’s a reason those images flood into\\nour mind the second we’re overwhelmed with joy. When we spend our lives\\n(knowingly or unknowingly) pushing away vulnerability, we can’t hold space\\nopen for the uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure of joy. For many of us,\\nthere’s even a physiological response—a “coming out of our skin” feeling.\\nWe’re desperate for more joy, but at the same time we can’t tolerate the\\nvulnerability.\\nAnd our culture assists in this doom-filled rehearsal: Most of us have a\\nstockpile of terrible images that we can pull from at the instant we’re grappling\\nwith vulnerability. I often ask audience members to raise their hands if they’ve\\nseen a graphically violent image in the past week. About twenty percent of the\\naudience normally raises their hands. Then I reframe the question: “Raise your\\nhand if you’ve watched the news, CSI, NCIS, Law & Order, Bones, or any other\\ncrime show on TV.” At that point about eighty to ninety percent of the audience\\nhands go up. We have the images we need to activate foreboding joy right at our\\nneurological fingertips.\\nWe’re visual people. We trust, consume, and mentally store what we see. I\\nremember recently being in the car with Steve and the kids as we headed to San\\nAntonio for a long weekend. Charlie was performing his new kindergarten\\nknock-knock joke routine for us, and we were all cracking up—even his older\\nsister. I started welling up with joy, and in the split second that vulnerability,\\njoy’s constant companion, hit me, I shuddered, recalling an image from the news\\nthat showed an overturned SUV on I-10 and two empty car seats lying on the\\nground next to the truck. My laughter turned to panic, and I remember blurting\\nout, “Slow down, Steve.” He looked at me with a puzzled expression and said,\\n“We’re stopped.”\\nDARING GREATLY: PRACTICING GRATITUDE\\nEven those of us who have learned to “lean into” joy and embrace our\\nexperiences are not immune to the uncomfortable quake of vulnerability that\\noften accompanies joyful moments. We’ve just learned how to use it as a\\nreminder rather than a warning shot. What was the most surprising (and life\\nchanging) difference for me was the nature of that reminder: For those\\nwelcoming the experience, the shudder of vulnerability that accompanies joy is\\nan invitation to practice gratitude, to acknowledge how truly grateful we are for\\nthe person, the beauty, the connection, or simply the moment before us.\\nGratitude, therefore, emerged from the data as the antidote to foreboding joy.\\nIn fact, every participant who spoke about the ability to stay open to joy also\\ntalked about the importance of practicing gratitude. This pattern of association\\nwas so thoroughly prevalent in the data that I made a commitment as a\\nresearcher not to talk about joy without talking about gratitude.\\nIt wasn’t just the relationship between joy and gratitude that took me by\\nsurprise. I was also startled by the fact that research participants consistently\\ndescribed both joyfulness and gratitude as spiritual practices that were bound to\\na belief in human connectedness and a power greater than us. Their stories and\\ndescriptions expanded on this, pointing to a clear distinction between happiness\\nand joy. Participants described happiness as an emotion that’s connected to\\ncircumstances, and they described joy as a spiritual way of engaging with the\\nworld that’s connected to practicing gratitude. While I was initially taken aback\\nby the relationship between joy and vulnerability, it now makes perfect sense to\\nme, and I can see why gratitude would be the antidote to foreboding joy.\\nScarcity and fear drive foreboding joy. We’re afraid that the feeling of joy\\nwon’t last, or that there won’t be enough, or that the transition to disappointment\\n(or whatever is in store for us next) will be too difficult. We’ve learned that\\ngiving in to joy is, at best, setting ourselves up for disappointment and, at worst,\\ninviting disaster. And we struggle with the worthiness issue. Do we deserve our\\njoy, given our inadequacies and imperfections? What about the starving children\\nand the war-ravaged world? Who are we to be joyful?\\nIf the opposite of scarcity is enough, then practicing gratitude is how we\\nacknowledge that there’s enough and that we’re enough. I use the word\\npracticing because the research participants spoke of tangible gratitude practices,\\nmore than merely having an attitude of gratitude or feeling grateful. In fact, they\\ngave specific examples of gratitude practices that included everything from\\nkeeping gratitude journals and gratitude jars to implementing family gratitude\\nrituals.\\nActually, I learned the most about gratitude practices and the relationship\\nbetween scarcity and joy that plays out in vulnerability from the men and women\\nwho had experienced some of the most profound losses or survived the greatest\\ntraumas. These included parents whose children had died, family members with\\nterminally ill loved ones, and genocide and trauma survivors. One of the\\nquestions I’m most often asked is “Don’t you get really depressed talking to\\npeople about vulnerability and hearing about people’s darkest struggles?” My\\nanswer is no, never. That’s because I’ve learned more about worthiness,\\nresilience, and joy from those people who courageously shared their struggles\\nwith me than from any other part of my work.\\nAnd nothing has been a greater gift to me than the three lessons I learned\\nabout joy and light from people who have spent time in sorrow and darkness:\\n1. Joy comes to us in moments—ordinary moments. We risk missing out\\non joy when we get too busy chasing down the extraordinary. Scarcity\\nculture may keep us afraid of living small, ordinary lives, but when you talk\\nto people who have survived great losses, it is clear that joy is not a\\nconstant. Without exception, all the participants who spoke to me about\\ntheir losses, and what they missed the most, spoke about ordinary moments.\\n“If I could come downstairs and see my husband sitting at the table and\\ncursing at the newspaper…” “If I could hear my son giggling in the\\nbackyard…” “My mom sent me the craziest texts—she never knew how to\\nwork her phone. I’d give anything to get one of those texts right now.”\\n2. Be grateful for what you have. When I asked people who had survived\\ntragedy how we can cultivate and show more compassion for people who\\nare suffering, the answer was always the same: Don’t shrink away from the\\njoy of your child because I’ve lost mine. Don’t take what you have for\\ngranted—celebrate it. Don’t apologize for what you have. Be grateful for it\\nand share your gratitude with others. Are your parents healthy? Be thrilled.\\nLet them know how much they mean to you. When you honor what you\\nhave, you’re honoring what I’ve lost.\\n3. Don’t squander joy. We can’t prepare for tragedy and loss. When we turn\\nevery opportunity to feel joy into a test drive for despair, we actually\\ndiminish our resilience. Yes, softening into joy is uncomfortable. Yes, it’s\\nscary. Yes, it’s vulnerable. But every time we allow ourselves to lean into\\njoy and give in to those moments, we build resilience and we cultivate hope.\\nThe joy becomes part of who we are, and when bad things happen—and\\nthey do happen—we are stronger.\\nIt took me a couple of years to understand and integrate this information, and\\nto start to cultivate a gratitude practice. Ellen, on the other hand, seemed to\\nintuitively understand the importance of acknowledging and owning joy. When\\nshe was in the first grade, we played hooky one afternoon and spent the day at\\nthe park. At one point we were on a paddleboat, feeding ducks stale bread that\\nwe had brought from home, when I realized that she had stopped pedaling and\\nwas sitting perfectly still in her seat. Her hands were wrapped around the bread\\nsack, her head was tilted back, and her eyes were closed. The sun was shining on\\nher uplifted face and she had a quiet smile on her face. I was so struck by her\\nbeauty and her vulnerability that I could barely catch my breath.\\nI watched for a full minute, but when she didn’t move, I got a little nervous.\\n“Ellie? Is everything okay, sweetie?”\\nHer smile widened and she opened her eyes. She looked at me and said, “I’m\\nfine, Mama. I was just making a picture memory.”\\nI had never heard of a picture memory, but I liked the sound of it. “What’s that\\nmean?”\\n“Oh, a picture memory is a picture I take in my mind when I’m really, really\\nhappy. I close my eyes and take a picture, so when I’m feeling sad or scared or\\nlonely, I can look at my picture memories.”\\nI’m not as eloquent or poised as my then six-year-old daughter, but I’ve been\\npracticing. For me, expressing gratitude is still bumpier than it is graceful or\\nfluid. I still get overwhelmed with vulnerability in the midst of joyful\\nexperiences. But now I’ve learned to literally say aloud, “I’m feeling vulnerable\\nand I’m so grateful for _________________.”\\nOkay, this can be fairly awkward in the middle of a conversation, but it’s\\nmuch better than the alternative—catastrophizing and controlling. Just recently,\\nSteve told me that he was thinking about taking the kids to his family’s\\nfarmhouse in Pennsylvania while I was out of town for work. I immediately\\nthought it was a great idea, until I started boarding the crazy train of Oh, my\\nGod, I can’t let them fly without me; what if something happens? Rather than\\npicking a fight, being critical, or making up something to quash the idea without\\nrevealing my unreasonable fears (e.g., “That’s a terrible idea. Airfare is really\\nhigh right now,” or, “That’s selfish. I want to go too.”), I just said,\\n“Vulnerability. Vulnerability. I’m grateful for…for…the kids getting to spend\\nalone time with you and explore the country outside.”\\nSteve smiled. He’s well aware of my practice, and he knew I meant it. Before\\nI put this research on countering foreboding joy into practice, I never knew how\\nto get past that immediate vulnerability shudder. I didn’t have the information to\\nget from what I feared, to how I actually felt, and to what I really craved:\\ngratitude-fueled joy.\\nTHE SHIELD: PERFECTIONISM\\nOne of my favorite features on my blog is my Inspiration Interviews series. It’s\\nspecial to me because I only interview people whom I find truly inspirational—\\npeople who engage with the world in a way that inspires me to be more creative\\nand a little bit braver with my own work. I’ve always asked interviewees the\\nsame group of questions, and after the Wholehearted research emerged, I started\\nasking questions about vulnerability and perfectionism. As a recovering\\nperfectionist and an aspiring good-enough-ist, I’m always finding myself\\nskimming down the list to read the answer to this question first: Is perfectionism\\nan issue for you? If so, what’s one of your strategies for managing it?\\nI ask this question because, in all of my data collecting, I’ve never heard one\\nperson attribute their joy, success, or Wholeheartedness to being perfect. In fact,\\nwhat I’ve heard over and over throughout the years is one clear message: “The\\nmost valuable and important things in my life came to me when I cultivated the\\ncourage to be vulnerable, imperfect, and self-compassionate.” Perfectionism is\\nnot the path that leads us to our gifts and to our sense of purpose; it’s the\\nhazardous detour.\\nI’m going to share a few of my favorite answers from the interviews with you,\\nbut first I want to tell you about the definition of perfectionism that bubbled up\\nfrom the data. Here’s what I learned:\\nLike vulnerability, perfectionism has accumulated around it a considerable\\nmythology. I think it’s helpful to start by looking at what perfectionism isn’t:\\nPerfectionism is not the same thing as striving for excellence. Perfectionism\\nis not about healthy achievement and growth. Perfectionism is a defensive\\nmove. It’s the belief that if we do things perfectly and look perfect, we can\\nminimize or avoid the pain of blame, judgment, and shame. Perfectionism\\nis a twenty-ton shield that we lug around, thinking it will protect us, when\\nin fact it’s the thing that’s really preventing us from being seen.\\nPerfectionism is not self-improvement. Perfectionism is, at its core, about\\ntrying to earn approval. Most perfectionists grew up being praised for\\nachievement and performance (grades, manners, rule following, people\\npleasing, appearance, sports). Somewhere along the way, they adopted this\\ndangerous and debilitating belief system: “I am what I accomplish and how\\nwell I accomplish it. Please. Perform. Perfect.” Healthy striving is self-\\nfocused: How can I improve? Perfectionism is other-focused: What will\\nthey think? Perfectionism is a hustle.\\nPerfectionism is not the key to success. In fact, research shows that\\nperfectionism hampers achievement. Perfectionism is correlated with\\ndepression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis or missed opportunities.\\nThe fear of failing, making mistakes, not meeting people’s expectations,\\nand being criticized keeps us outside of the arena where healthy\\ncompetition and striving unfolds.\\nLast, perfectionism is not a way to avoid shame. Perfectionism is a form of\\nshame. Where we struggle with perfectionism, we struggle with shame.\\nAfter using the data to bushwhack my way through the myths, I then\\ndeveloped the following definition of perfectionism:\\nPerfectionism is a self-destructive and addictive belief system that fuels this\\nprimary thought: If I look perfect and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or\\nminimize the painful feelings of shame, judgment, and blame.\\nPerfectionism is self-destructive simply because perfection doesn’t exist.\\nIt’s an unattainable goal. Perfectionism is more about perception than\\ninternal motivation, and there is no way to control perception, no matter\\nhow much time and energy we spend trying.\\nPerfectionism is addictive, because when we invariably do experience\\nshame, judgment, and blame, we often believe it’s because we weren’t\\nperfect enough. Rather than questioning the faulty logic of perfectionism,\\nwe become even more entrenched in our quest to look and do everything\\njust right.\\nPerfectionism actually sets us up to feel shame, judgment, and blame,\\nwhich then leads to even more shame and self-blame: “It’s my fault. I’m\\nfeeling this way because I’m not good enough.”\\nDARING \\nGREATLY: \\nAPPRECIATING \\nTHE\\nBEAUTY OF CRACKS\\nJust as our experiences of foreboding joy can be located on a continuum, I found\\nthat most of us fall somewhere on a perfectionism continuum. In other words,\\nwhen it comes to hiding our flaws, managing perception, and wanting to win\\nover folks, we’re all hustling a little. For some folks, perfectionism may only\\nemerge when they’re feeling particularly vulnerable. For others, perfectionism is\\ncompulsive, chronic, and debilitating—it looks and feels like an addiction.\\nRegardless of where we are on this continuum, if we want freedom from\\nperfectionism, we have to make the long journey from “What will people\\nthink?” to “I am enough.” That journey begins with shame resilience, self-\\ncompassion, and owning our stories. To claim the truths about who we are,\\nwhere we come from, what we believe, and the very imperfect nature of our\\nlives, we have to be willing to give ourselves a break and appreciate the beauty\\nof our cracks or imperfections. To be kinder and gentler with ourselves and each\\nother. To talk to ourselves the same way we’d talk to someone we care about.\\nDr. Kristin Neff, a researcher and professor at the University of Texas at\\nAustin, runs the Self-Compassion Research Lab, where she studies how we\\ndevelop and practice self-compassion. According to Neff, self-compassion has\\nthree elements: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. In her new\\nbook, Self-Compassion: Stop Beating Yourself Up and Leave Insecurity Behind,\\nshe defines each of these elements:\\nSelf-kindness: Being warm and understanding toward ourselves when we\\nsuffer, fail, or feel inadequate, rather than ignoring our pain or flagellating\\nourselves with self-criticism.\\nCommon humanity: Common humanity recognizes that suffering and\\nfeelings of personal inadequacy are part of the shared human experience—\\nsomething we all go through rather than something that happens to “me”\\nalone.\\nMindfulness: Taking a balanced approach to negative emotions so that\\nfeelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. We cannot ignore our pain\\nand feel compassion for it at the same time. Mindfulness requires that we\\nnot “overidentify” with thoughts and feelings, so that we are caught up and\\nswept away by negativity.\\nI love how her definition of mindfulness reminds us that being mindful also\\nmeans not overidentifying with or exaggerating our feelings. For me, it’s so easy\\nto get stuck in regret or shame or self-criticism when I make a mistake. But self-\\ncompassion requires an observant and accurate perspective when feeling shame\\nor pain. Neff has a great website where you can take a self-compassion inventory\\nand learn more about her research. The Web address is www.self-\\ncompassion.org.\\nIn addition to practicing self-compassion (and trust me, like gratitude and\\neverything else worthwhile, it’s a practice), we must also remember that our\\nworthiness, that core belief that we are enough, comes only when we live inside\\nour story. We either own our stories (even the messy ones), or we stand outside\\nof them—denying our vulnerabilities and imperfections, orphaning the parts of\\nus that don’t fit in with who/what we think we’re supposed to be, and hustling\\nfor other people’s approval of our worthiness. Perfectionism is exhausting\\nbecause hustling is exhausting. It’s a never-ending performance.\\nI want to go back now to the Inspiration Interviews series from my blog and\\nshare some of the responses with you. In these responses I see the beauty of\\nbeing real—of embracing the cracks—and I’m inspired by the self-compassion. I\\nthink they’ll inspire you too. The first is from Gretchen Rubin, the best-selling\\nwriter whose book The Happiness Project is the account of the year she spent\\ntest-driving studies and theories about how to be happier. Her new book,\\nHappier at Home, focuses on the factors that matter at home, such as\\npossessions, marriage, time, parenthood, neighborhood. Here’s how she\\nanswered the question about managing perfectionism:\\nI remind myself, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” (Cribbed from Voltaire.) A twenty-minute walk that I do is\\nbetter than the four-mile run that I don’t do. The imperfect book that gets published is better than the perfect book that never\\nleaves my computer. The dinner party of take-out Chinese food is better than the elegant dinner that I never host.\\nAndrea Scher is a photographer, writer, and life coach living in Berkeley,\\nCalifornia. Through her e-courses “Superhero Photo” and “Mondo Beyondo”\\nand her award-winning blog Superhero Journal, Andrea inspires others to live\\nauthentic, colorful, and creative lives. You can often find her sitting on the\\nkitchen floor, holding her new baby, and asking her four-year-old son to leap so\\nshe can take a superhero portrait. She writes here about perfectionism (I love her\\nmantras!):\\nI was a competitive gymnast as a kid, got perfect attendance every year in school, was terrified of getting anything worse\\nthan an A minus, and had an eating disorder in high school.\\nOh, and I think I was the homecoming queen.\\nYep. I think I have some issues with perfectionism!\\nBut I have been working on it. As a kid, I equated being perfect with being loved…and I think I still confuse the two. I\\noften find myself doing what Brené calls “the hustle for worthiness.” That dance we do so that people don’t see how incredibly\\nflawed and human we are. Sometimes I have my self-worth wrapped up in what I do and how good I look doing it, but mostly\\nI am learning to let go. Parenthood has taught me a lot about that. It’s messy and humbling, and I am learning to show my\\nmess.\\nTo manage my perfectionism I give myself tons of permission to do things that are good enough. I do things quickly\\n(having two small children will teach you how to do most tasks at lightning speed), and if it’s good enough, it gets my stamp\\nof approval. I have a few mantras that help:\\nQuick and dirty wins the race.\\nPerfection is the enemy of done.\\nGood enough is really effin’ good.\\nNicholas Wilton is the artist behind the beautiful illustrations on my earlier\\nbook covers and my website. In addition to showings in gallery exhibitions and\\ninclusion in private collections, he is the founder of the Artplane Method, a\\nsystem of fundamental painting and intuition principles that help enable the\\ncreative process.\\nI absolutely love what he writes about perfectionism and art. It completely\\naligns with the research finding that perfectionism crushes creativity—which is\\nwhy one of the most effective ways to start recovering from perfectionism is to\\nstart creating. Here’s what Nick has to say:\\nI always felt that someone, a long time ago, organized the affairs of the world into areas that made sense—categories of\\nstuff that is perfectible, things that fit neatly in perfect bundles. The world of business, for example, is this way—line items,\\nspreadsheets, things that add up, that can be perfected. The legal system—not always perfect, but nonetheless a mind-numbing\\neffort to actually write down all kinds of laws and instructions that cover all aspects of being human, a kind of umbrella code\\nof conduct we should all follow.\\nPerfection is crucial in building an aircraft, a bridge, or a high-speed train. The code and mathematics residing just below\\nthe surface of the Internet is also this way. Things are either perfectly right or they will not work. So much of the world we\\nwork and live in is based upon being correct, being perfect.\\nBut after this someone got through organizing everything just perfectly, he (or probably a she) was left with a bunch of\\nstuff that didn’t fit anywhere—things in a shoe box that had to go somewhere.\\nSo in desperation this person threw up her arms and said, “OK! Fine. All the rest of this stuff that isn’t perfectible, that\\ndoesn’t seem to fit anywhere else, will just have to be piled into this last, rather large, tattered box that we can sort of push\\nbehind the couch. Maybe later we can come back and figure where it all is supposed to fit in. Let’s label the box ART.”\\nThe problem was thankfully never fixed, and in time the box overflowed as more and more art piled up. I think the\\ndilemma exists because art, among all the other tidy categories, most closely resembles what it is like to be human. To be\\nalive. It is our nature to be imperfect. To have uncategorized feelings and emotions. To make or do things that don’t sometimes\\nnecessarily make sense.\\nArt is all just perfectly imperfect.\\nOnce the word Art enters the description of what you’re up to, it is almost like getting a hall pass from perfection. It\\nthankfully releases us from any expectation of perfection.\\nIn relation to my own work not being perfect, I just always point to the tattered box behind the couch and mention the\\nword Art, and people seem to understand and let you off the hook about being perfect and go back to their business.\\nThere’s a quote that I share every time I talk about vulnerability and\\nperfectionism. My fixation with these words from Leonard Cohen’s song\\n“Anthem” comes from how much comfort and hope they give me as I put\\n“enough” into practice: “There’s a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets\\nin.”\\nTHE SHIELD: NUMBING\\nIf you’re wondering if this section is about addiction and you’re thinking, This\\nisn’t about me, please read on. This is about all of us. First, one of the most\\nuniversal numbing strategies is what I call crazy-busy. I often say that when they\\nstart having twelve-step meetings for busy-aholics, they’ll need to rent out\\nfootball stadiums. We are a culture of people who’ve bought into the idea that if\\nwe stay busy enough, the truth of our lives won’t catch up with us.\\nSecond, statistics dictate that there are very few people who haven’t been\\naffected by addiction. I believe we all numb our feelings. We may not do it\\ncompulsively and chronically, which is addiction, but that doesn’t mean that we\\ndon’t numb our sense of vulnerability. And numbing vulnerability is especially\\ndebilitating because it doesn’t just deaden the pain of our difficult experiences;\\nnumbing vulnerability also dulls our experiences of love, joy, belonging,\\ncreativity, and empathy. We can’t selectively numb emotion. Numb the dark and\\nyou numb the light.\\nIf you’re also wondering if numbing refers to doing illegal drugs or having a\\nfew glasses of wine after work—the answer is yes. I’m going to argue that we\\nneed to examine the idea of “taking the edge off,” and that means considering\\nthe glasses of wine we drink while we’re cooking dinner, eating dinner, and\\ncleaning up after dinner, our sixty-hour workweeks, the sugar, the fantasy\\nfootball, the prescription pills, and the four shots of espresso that we drink in\\norder to clear the fog from the wine and Advil PM. I’m talking about you and\\nme and the stuff we do every day.\\nWhen I looked at the data, my primary question was “What are we numbing\\nand why?” Americans today are more debt-ridden, obese, medicated, and\\naddicted than we ever have been. For the first time in history, the Centers for\\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced that automobile accidents\\nare now the second leading cause of accidental death in the United States. The\\nleading cause? Drug overdoses. In fact, more people die from prescription drug\\noverdoses than from heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine drug use combined.\\nEven more alarming is the estimate that less than 5 percent of those who died\\nfrom prescription drug overdoses obtained their drugs from the folks we\\nnormally think of as street-corner drug dealers. The dealers today are more likely\\nto be parents, relatives, friends, and physicians. Clearly there’s a problem. We’re\\ndesperate to feel less or more of something—to make something go away or to\\nhave more of something else.\\nHaving spent years working closely with addiction researchers and clinicians,\\nI had guessed that the primary driver of numbing would be our struggles with\\nworthiness and shame: We numb the pain that comes from feeling inadequate\\nand “less than.” But that was only part of the puzzle. Anxiety and disconnection\\nalso emerged as drivers of numbing in addition to shame. As I’ll explain, the\\nmost powerful need for numbing seems to come from combinations of all three\\n—shame, anxiety, and disconnection.\\nThe anxiety described by the research participants appeared to be fueled by\\nuncertainty, overwhelming and competing demands on our time, and (one of the\\nbig surprises) social discomfort. Disconnection was tougher to nail down. I\\nthought about using the term depression rather than disconnection, but as I\\nrecoded the data, that’s not what I heard. I instead heard a range of experiences\\nthat encompassed depression but also included loneliness, isolation,\\ndisengagement, and emptiness.\\nAgain, what was really powerful for me, personally and professionally, was\\nseeing the strong pattern of shame threading through the experiences of anxiety\\nand/or disconnection. The most accurate answers to the question about what\\ndrives numbing sound more like the answers to “What’s your sign?” Anxiety\\nwith shame rising. Disconnection with shame rising. Anxiety and disconnection\\nwith shame rising.\\nShame enters for those of us who experience anxiety because not only are we\\nfeeling fearful, out of control, and incapable of managing our increasingly\\ndemanding lives, but eventually our anxiety is compounded and made\\nunbearable by our belief that if we were just smarter, stronger, or better, we’d be\\nable to handle everything. Numbing here becomes a way to take the edge off of\\nboth instability and inadequacy.\\nWith disconnection it’s a similar story. We may have a couple of hundred\\nfriends on Facebook, plus a slew of colleagues, real-life friends, and neighbors,\\nbut we feel alone and unseen. Because we are hardwired for connection,\\ndisconnection always creates pain. Feeling disconnected can be a normal part of\\nlife and relationships, but when coupled with the shame of believing that we’re\\ndisconnected because we’re not worthy of connection, it creates a pain that we\\nwant to numb.\\nOne stop beyond disconnection is isolation, which presents real danger. Jean\\nBaker Miller and Irene Stiver, relational-cultural theorists from the Stone Center\\nat Wellesley College, have eloquently captured the extremity of isolation. They\\nwrite, “We believe that the most terrifying and destructive feeling that a person\\ncan experience is psychological isolation. This is not the same as being alone. It\\nis a feeling that one is locked out of the possibility of human connection and of\\nbeing powerless to change the situation. In the extreme, psychological isolation\\ncan lead to a sense of hopelessness and desperation. People will do almost\\nanything to escape this combination of condemned isolation and powerlessness.”\\nThe part of this definition that is critical to understanding shame is the\\nsentence “People will do almost anything to escape this combination of\\ncondemned isolation and powerlessness.” Shame often leads to desperation. And\\nreactions to this desperate need to escape from isolation and fear can run the\\ngamut from numbing to addiction, depression, self-injury, eating disorders,\\nbullying, violence, and suicide.\\nAs I thought back on my own numbing history, understanding how shame\\nmagnifies anxiety and disconnection provided me with answers to questions that\\nI’ve had for years. I didn’t start drinking to drown my sorrows: I just needed\\nsomething to do with my hands. In fact, I’m convinced that if smart phones and\\nthe bejeweled Chihuahuas that today’s celebrities sport as accessories had been\\nin fashion when I was in my late teens, I never would have started smoking and\\ndrinking. I drank and smoked to minimize my feelings of vulnerability and to\\nlook busy when all of the other girls at my table had been asked to dance. I\\nliterally needed something to do, something to help me look busy.\\nTwenty-five years ago it felt as if my only choice was nursing a beer, stirring\\nan amaretto sour, or fiddling with a cigarette. I was alone at the table with no one\\nand nothing to keep me company except for my vices. For me, vulnerability led\\nto anxiety, which led to shame, which led to disconnection, which led to Bud\\nLight. For many of us, the literal chemical anesthetizing of emotions is just a\\npleasant, albeit dangerous, side effect of behaviors that are more about fitting in,\\nfinding connection, and managing anxiety.\\nI quit drinking and smoking sixteen years ago. In The Gifts of Imperfection, I\\nwrite:\\nI wasn’t raised with the skills and emotional practice needed to “lean into discomfort,” so over time I basically became a\\ntake-the-edge-off-aholic. But they don’t have meetings for that. And after some brief experimenting, I learned that describing\\nyour addiction that way in a traditional twelve-step meeting doesn’t always go over very well with the purists.\\nFor me, it wasn’t just the dance halls, cold beer, and Marlboro Lights of my youth that got out of hand—it was banana\\nbread, chips and queso, e-mail, work, staying busy, incessant worrying, planning, perfectionism, and anything else that could\\ndull those agonizing and anxiety-fueled feelings of vulnerability.\\nLet’s look at the Daring Greatly strategies for numbing.\\nDARING GREATLY: SETTING BOUNDARIES,\\nFINDING TRUE COMFORT, AND CULTIVATING\\nSPIRIT\\nWhen I interviewed the research participants, whom I’d describe as living a\\nWholehearted life, about numbing, they consistently talked about three things:\\n1. Learning how to actually feel their feelings.\\n2. Staying mindful about numbing behaviors (they struggled too).\\n3. Learning how to lean into the discomfort of hard emotions.\\nThis all made perfect sense to me, but I wanted to know exactly how you lean\\ninto anxiety and disconnection. So I started interviewing people about this\\nquestion specifically. As I expected, there was more to it. These folks had\\nelevated “enough” to whole new levels. Yes, they practiced mindfulness and\\nleaning, but they also set serious boundaries in their lives.\\nAs I asked more pointed questions about the choices and behaviors\\nWholehearted men and women made to reduce anxiety, they explained that\\nreducing anxiety meant paying attention to how much they could do and how\\nmuch was too much, and learning how to say, “Enough.” They got very clear on\\nwhat was important to them and when they could let something go.\\nIn Sir Ken Robinson’s wonderful 2010 TED talk on the learning revolution,\\nhe starts to explain to the audience that he divides the world into two groups,\\nthen he stops himself and with great humor says, “Jeremy Bentham, the great\\nutilitarian philosopher, once spiked this argument. He said, ‘There are two types\\nof people in the world, those who divide people into two types, and those who\\ndo not.’”\\nRobinson paused and smiled. “Well, I do.” I loved that because as a\\nresearcher, I do too. But before I talk about the two groups I identified, I want to\\nsay that this division is not exactly as neat and tidy as two discrete groups, and at\\nthe same time it almost is. Let’s take a look.\\nWhen it comes to anxiety, we all struggle. Yes, there are different types of\\nanxiety and certainly different intensities. Some anxiety is hardwired and best\\naddressed with a combination of medication and therapy, and some of it is\\nenvironmental—we’re overextended and overstressed. What was interesting to\\nme was how the participants could be divided into two camps: Group A defined\\nthe challenge of anxiety as finding ways to manage and soothe the anxiety, while\\nGroup B clearly defined the problem as changing the behaviors that led to\\nanxiety. Participants from both groups often used today’s dominating technology\\nas an example of an anxiety-producing source during the interviews, so let’s look\\nat how these two groups thought differently about the daily onslaught of e-mail,\\nvoicemail, and text messages.\\nGroup A: “I make a pot of coffee after I tuck in my kids so I can take care of all the e-mails between ten P.M. and midnight. If\\nthere are too many, I wake up at four A.M. and start over again. I don’t like getting to work with any unanswered e-mail in my\\nin-box. I’m exhausted, but they’re answered.”\\nGroup B: “I’ve simply stopped sending unnecessary e-mails and asked my friends and colleagues to do the same. I’ve also\\nstarted setting the expectation that it might take me a few days to respond. If it’s important, call me. Don’t text or e-mail. Call.\\nBetter yet, stop by my office.”\\nGroup A: “I use red lights, grocery lines, and elevator rides to stay on top of my calls. I even sleep with my phone in case\\nsomeone calls or I remember something in the middle of the night. One time I called my assistant at four A.M. because I\\nremembered that we needed to add something to a motion that we were preparing. I was surprised that she answered, but then\\nshe reminded me that I had told her to keep her phone on her nightstand. I’ll rest and let off steam when we’re done. Work\\nhard. Play hard. That’s my motto. And it doesn’t take much to play hard when you haven’t slept in a while.”\\nGroup B: “My boss, my friends, and my family know that I don’t take calls before nine A.M. or after nine P.M. If the phone\\nrings after or before those times, it’s either a wrong number or an emergency—a real emergency, not a work issue.”\\nThe participants who struggled the most with numbing, Group A, explained\\nthat reducing anxiety meant finding ways to numb it, not changing the thinking,\\nbehaviors, or emotions that created anxiety. I hated every minute of this part of\\nthe research. I’ve always looked for better ways to manage my exhaustion and\\nanxiety. I wanted help “living like this,” not suggestions on how to “stop living\\nlike this.” My struggle mirrored the struggle that I heard from the folks who\\ntalked the most about numbing. The smaller group, Group B—the participants\\nwho addressed anxiety at the root by aligning their lives with their values and\\nsetting boundaries—fell on the Wholehearted continuum.\\nWhen we asked that group about the process of setting boundaries and limits\\nto lower the anxiety in their lives, they didn’t hesitate to connect worthiness with\\nboundaries. We have to believe we are enough in order to say, “Enough!” For\\nwomen, setting boundaries is difficult because the shame gremlins are quick to\\nweigh in: “Careful saying no. You’ll really disappoint these folks. Don’t let them\\ndown. Be a good girl. Make everyone happy.” For men, the gremlins whisper,\\n“Man up. A real guy could take this on and then some. Is the little mamma’s boy\\njust too tired?”\\nWe know that daring greatly means engaging with our vulnerability, which\\ncan’t happen when shame has the upper hand, and the same is true for dealing\\nwith anxiety-fueled disconnection. The two most powerful forms of connection\\nare love and belonging—they are both irreducible needs of men, women, and\\nchildren. As I conducted my interviews, I realized that only one thing separated\\nthe men and women who felt a deep sense of love and belonging from the people\\nwho seemed to be struggling for it. That one thing was the belief in their\\nworthiness. It’s as simple and complicated as this: If we want to fully experience\\nlove and belonging, we must believe that we are worthy of love and belonging.\\nBut before we talk more about numbing and disconnection, I want to share two\\nmore definitions with you. I shared my definition of love on page 105, here are\\nthe definitions of connection and belonging that emerged from the data.\\nConnection: Connection is the energy that is created between people when\\nthey feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without\\njudgment.\\nBelonging: Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something\\nlarger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by\\nfitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for\\nbelonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we\\npresent our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can\\nnever be greater than our level of self-acceptance.\\nThese definitions are crucial to understanding how we become disconnected\\nin our lives and how to change. Living a connected life ultimately is about\\nsetting boundaries, spending less time and energy hustling and winning over\\npeople who don’t matter, and seeing the value of working on cultivating\\nconnection with family and close friends.\\nBefore I undertook this research, my question was “What’s the quickest way\\nto make these feelings go away?” Today my question is “What are these feelings\\nand where did they come from?” Invariably, the answers are that I’m not feeling\\nconnected enough to Steve or the kids, and that this comes from (take your pick)\\nnot sleeping enough, not playing enough, working too much, or trying to run\\nfrom vulnerability. What has changed for me is that I know now that I can\\naddress these answers.\\nTHE CARE AND FEEDING OF OUR SPIRITS\\nOne final question remains, and I hear it a lot. People often ask, “Where is the\\nline between pleasure or comfort and numbing?” In response, author and\\npersonal growth teacher Jennifer Louden has named our numbing devices\\n“shadow comforts.” When we’re anxious, disconnected, vulnerable, alone, and\\nfeeling helpless, the booze and food and work and endless hours online feel like\\ncomfort, but in reality they’re only casting their long shadows over our lives.\\nIn her book The Life Organizer, Louden writes, “Shadow comforts can take\\nany form. It’s not what you do; it’s why you do it that makes the difference. You\\ncan eat a piece of chocolate as a holy wafer of sweetness—a real comfort—or\\nyou can cram an entire chocolate bar into your mouth without even tasting it in a\\nfrantic attempt to soothe yourself—a shadow comfort. You can chat on message\\nboards for half an hour and be energized by community and ready to go back to\\nwork, or you can chat on message boards because you’re avoiding talking to\\nyour partner about how angry he or she made you last night.”\\nI found that what emerged from the data was exactly what Louden points out:\\n“It’s not what you do; it’s why you do it that makes the difference.” The\\ninvitation is to think about the intention behind our choices and, if helpful, to\\ndiscuss these issues with family, close friends, or a helping professional. There\\naren’t any checklists or norms to help you identify shadow comforts or other\\ndestructive numbing behavior. This requires self-examination and reflection.\\nAdditionally, I would recommend listening with great care if the people you love\\nsay that they are concerned about you engaging in these types of behaviors. But\\nultimately these are questions that transcend what we know and how we feel—\\nthey’re about our spirit. Are my choices comforting and nourishing my spirit, or\\nare they temporary reprieves from vulnerability and difficult emotions ultimately\\ndiminishing my spirit? Are my choices leading to my Wholeheartedness, or do\\nthey leave me feeling empty and searching?\\nFor me, sitting down to a wonderful meal is nourishment and pleasure. Eating\\nwhile I’m standing, be it in front of the refrigerator or inside the pantry, is always\\na red flag. Sitting down to watch one of my favorite shows on television is\\npleasure. Flipping through channels for an hour is numbing.\\nAs we think about nourishing or diminishing our spirit, we have to consider\\nhow our numbing behaviors affect the people around us—even strangers. A\\ncouple of years ago, I wrote an op-ed about cell phones and disconnection for\\nthe Houston Chronicle after witnessing how our crazy-busy, anxiety-fueled\\nlifestyles affect other people. Food for thought:\\nLast week, while I was trying to enjoy my manicure, I watched in horror as the two women across from me talked on their\\nphones the entire time they were getting their nails done. They employed head nods, eyebrow raises, and finger-pointing to\\ninstruct the manicurists on things like nail length and polish choices.\\nI really couldn’t believe it.\\nI’ve had my nails done by the same two women for ten years. I know their names (their real Vietnamese names), their\\nchildren’s names, and many of their stories. They know my name, my children’s names, and many of my stories. When I\\nfinally made a comment about the women on their cell phones, they both quickly averted their eyes. Finally, in a whisper, the\\nmanicurist said, “They don’t know. Most of them don’t think of us as people.”\\nOn the way home, I stopped at Barnes & Noble to pick up a magazine. The woman ahead of me in line bought two books,\\napplied for a new “reader card,” and asked to get one book gift-wrapped without getting off of her cell phone. She plowed\\nthrough the entire exchange without making eye contact or directly speaking to the young woman working at the counter. She\\nnever acknowledged the presence of the human being across from her.\\nAfter leaving Barnes & Noble, I went to a drive-through fast food restaurant to get a Diet Dr Pepper. Right as I pulled up\\nto the window, my cell phone rang. I wasn’t quite sure, but I thought it might be Charlie’s school calling, so I answered it. It\\nwasn’t the school—it was someone calling to confirm an appointment. I got off the phone as quickly as I could.\\nIn the short time it took me to say, “Yes, I’ll be at my appointment,” the woman in the window and I had finished our\\nsoda-for-money transaction. I apologized to her the second I got off of the phone. I said, “I’m so sorry. The phone rang right\\nwhen I was pulling up and I thought it was my son’s school.”\\nI must have surprised her because she got huge tears in her eyes and said, “Thank you. Thank you so much. You have no\\nidea how humiliating it is sometimes. They don’t even see us.”\\nI don’t know how it feels for her, but I do know how it feels to be an invisible member of the service industry. It can suck.\\nI worked my way through undergrad and some of graduate school by waiting tables and bartending. I worked in a very nice\\nrestaurant that was close to campus and a hot spot for wealthy college kids and their parents (parents who were visiting for the\\nweekend and treating their kids and their kids’ friends to dinner). I was in my late twenties and praying to finish my bachelor’s\\ndegree before I hit thirty.\\nWhen the customers were kind and respectful, it was OK, but one “waiter as object” moment could tear me apart.\\nUnfortunately, I now see those moments happening all of the time.\\nI see adults who don’t even look at their waiters when they speak to them. I see parents who let their young children talk\\ndown to store clerks. I see people rage and scream at receptionists, then treat the bosses/doctors/bankers with the utmost\\nrespect.\\nAnd I see the insidious nature of race, class, and privilege playing out in one of the most historically damaging ways\\npossible—the server/served relationship.\\nEveryone wants to know why customer service has gone to hell in a handbasket. I want to know why customer behavior\\nhas gone to hell in a handbasket.\\nWhen we treat people as objects, we dehumanize them. We do something really terrible to their souls and to our own.\\nMartin Buber, an Austrian-born philosopher, wrote about the differences between an I-it relationship and an I-you relationship.\\nAn I-it relationship is basically what we create when we are in transactions with people whom we treat like objects—people\\nwho are simply there to serve us or complete a task. I-you relationships are characterized by human connection and empathy.\\nBuber wrote, “When two people relate to each other authentically and humanly, God is the electricity that surges between\\nthem.”\\nAfter spending a decade studying belonging, authenticity, and shame, I can say for certain that we are hardwired for\\nconnection—emotionally, physically, and spiritually. I’m not suggesting that we engage in a deep, meaningful relationship\\nwith the man who works at the cleaners or the woman who works at the drive-through, but I am suggesting that we stop\\ndehumanizing people and start looking them in the eye when we speak to them. If we don’t have the energy or time to do that,\\nwe should stay at home.\\nSpirituality emerged as a fundamental guidepost in Wholeheartedness. Not\\nreligiosity but the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to one\\nanother by a force greater than ourselves—a force grounded in love and\\ncompassion. For some of us that’s God, for others it’s nature, art, or even human\\nsoulfulness. I believe that owning our worthiness is the act of acknowledging\\nthat we are sacred. Perhaps embracing vulnerability and overcoming numbing is\\nultimately about the care and feeding of our spirits.\\nTHE LESS FREQUENTED SHELVES IN THE\\nARMORY\\nSo far, we’ve cracked open the armory doors to throw some light on the common\\narsenal that pretty much everyone uses to keep themselves safe from\\nvulnerability. Foreboding joy, perfectionism, and numbing have emerged as the\\nthree most universal methods of protection—what we call major categories of\\ndefense. In this last part of the chapter, I want to briefly explore the less\\nfrequented shelves in the armory where a few more masks and pieces that form\\nimportant subcategories of shielding are kept. Most of us are likely to identify\\nwith one or more of these protection mechanisms, or, at the very least, we will\\nsee slivers of ourselves reflected back from their polished surfaces in a way that\\ncultivates some understanding.\\nTHE SHIELD: VIKING OR VICTIM\\nI recognized this piece of armor when a significant group of research participants\\nindicated they had very little use for the concept of vulnerability. Their responses\\nto the idea that vulnerability might have value ranged from dismissive and\\ndefensive to hostile. What emerged from these interviews and interactions was a\\nlens on the world that essentially saw people divided into two groups (ahem, like\\nme and Sir Ken Robinson) that I call Vikings or Victims.\\nUnlike some participants who had intellectual or theoretical issues with the\\nvalue of vulnerability, these folks shared the belief that everyone without\\nexception belongs to one of two mutually exclusive groups: Either you’re a\\nVictim in life—a sucker or a loser who’s always being taken advantage of and\\ncan’t hold your own—or you’re a Viking—someone who sees the threat of being\\nvictimized as a constant, so you stay in control, you dominate, you exert power\\nover things, and you never show vulnerability.\\nAs I coded the data from these interviews, I kept thinking about the chapter in\\nmy dissertation on the French philosopher Jacques Derrida and binary opposition\\n(the pairing of related terms that are opposite). While the respondents didn’t all\\nuse the same examples, a strong pattern of paired opposites emerged in the\\nlanguage they used to describe their worldview: winner or loser, survive or die,\\nkill or be killed, strong or weak, leaders or followers, success or failure, crush or\\nbe crushed. And in case those aren’t clear enough examples, there’s the life\\nmotto of a high-achieving, take-no-prisoners lawyer, “The world is divided into\\nassholes and suckers. It’s that simple.”\\nThe source of their Viking-or-Victim worldview was not completely clear, but\\nmost attributed it to the values they had been taught growing up, the experience\\nof surviving hardships, or their professional training. The majority of the\\nparticipants who fell into the group holding this view were men, but there were\\nalso women. It makes sense that this is a somewhat gendered issue as many men,\\neven men who don’t rely on this armor, talked about the win-lose-zero-sum-\\npower dynamic being taught and modeled as they grew up. And, don’t forget,\\nwinning, dominance, and power over women were part of the list of masculine\\nnorms that we discussed in Chapter 3.\\nIn addition to socialization and life experiences, many of these folks held jobs\\nor worked in cultures that reinforced the Viking-or-Victim mentality: We heard\\nthis from servicemen and -women, veterans, corrections and law-enforcement\\nofficers, and people working in high-performance, supercompetitive cultures like\\nlaw, technology, and finance. What I don’t know is if these folks sought careers\\nthat leveraged their existing Viking-or-Victim belief system, or if their work\\nexperiences shaped this win-or-lose take on life. My guess would be that a larger\\npercentage of folks belong to the former group, but I don’t have the data to do\\nmore than speculate. It’s something we’re researching now.\\nOne issue that made these interviews some of the most difficult was the\\nhonesty with which people spoke about the struggles in their personal lives—\\ndealing with high-risk behaviors, divorces, disconnection, loneliness, addiction,\\nanger, exhaustion. But rather than seeing these behaviors and negative outcomes\\nas consequences of their Viking-or-Victim worldview, they perceived them as\\nevidence of the harsh win-or-lose nature of life.\\nWhen I look at the statistics in more vulnerability-intolerant Viking-or-Victim\\nprofessions, I see a dangerous pattern developing. And no place is this more\\nevident than in the military. The statistics on post-traumatic-stress-related\\nsuicides, violence, addiction, and risk-taking all point to this haunting truth: For\\nsoldiers serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, coming home is more lethal than being\\nin combat. From the invasion of Afghanistan to the summer of 2009, the US\\nmilitary lost 761 soldiers in combat in that country. Compare that to the 817 who\\ntook their own lives over the same period. And this number doesn’t account for\\ndeaths related to violence, high-risk behaviors, and addiction.\\nCraig Bryan, a University of Texas psychologist and suicide expert who\\nrecently left the air force, told Time magazine that the military finds itself in a\\ncatch-22: “We train our warriors to use controlled violence and aggression, to\\nsuppress strong emotional reactions in the face of adversity, to tolerate physical\\nand emotional pain, and to overcome the fear of injury and death. These qualities\\nare also associated with increased risk for suicide.” Bryan then explained that the\\nmilitary can’t decrease the intensity of that conditioning “without negatively\\naffecting the fighting capability of our military.” And he gave chilling expression\\nto the inherent danger of looking at the world through the Viking-or-Victim lens\\nfor those in the military when he noted, “Service members are, simply put, more\\ncapable of killing themselves by sheer consequence of their professional\\ntraining.” The situation may be at its most extreme in the military, but if you\\nlook at the mental and physical health statistics of police officers, you’ll find the\\nsame thing.\\nThe same holds true in organizations—when we lead, teach, or preach from a\\ngospel of Viking or Victim, win or lose, we crush faith, innovation, creativity,\\nand adaptability to change. Take away the guns, in fact, and we find outcomes\\nsimilar to those for soldiers and police in corporate America. Lawyers—an\\nexample of a profession largely trained in win or lose, succeed or fail—have\\noutcomes that aren’t much better. The American Bar Association reports that\\nsuicides among lawyers are close to four times greater than the rate of the\\ngeneral population. An American Bar Association Journal article reported that\\nexperts on lawyer depression and substance abuse attributed the higher suicide\\nrate to lawyers’ perfectionism and on their need to be aggressive and emotionally\\ndetached. And this mentality can trickle down into our home lives as well. When\\nwe teach or model to our children that vulnerability is dangerous and should be\\npushed away, we lead them directly into danger and disconnection.\\nThe Viking or Victim armor doesn’t just perpetuate behaviors such as\\ndominance, control, and power over folks who see themselves as Vikings, it can\\nalso perpetuate a sense of ongoing victimhood for people who constantly\\nstruggle with the idea that they’re being targeted or unfairly treated. With this\\nlens, there are only two possible positions that people can occupy—power over\\nor powerless. In the interviews I heard many participants sound resigned to\\nVictim simply because they didn’t want to become the only alternative in their\\nopinion—Vikings. Reducing our life options to such limited and extreme roles\\nleaves very little hope for transformation and meaningful change. I think that’s\\nwhy there’s often a sense of desperation and feeling “boxed in” around this\\nperspective.\\nDARING GREATLY: REDEFINING SUCCESS,\\nREINTEGRATING \\nVULNERABILITY, \\nAND\\nSEEKING SUPPORT\\nTo examine how the research participants moved from Viking or Victim to\\nengaging in vulnerability, there was a clear distinction between those who\\noperated from this belief system because it’s what they learned or it’s a value\\nthey hold, and those who rely on this life lens as a result of trauma. Ultimately\\nthe question that best challenges the logic behind Viking or Victim for both\\ngroups is this: How are you defining success?\\nIt turns out that in this win-or-lose, succeed-or-fail paradigm, Vikings are not\\nvictorious by any metric that most of us would label “success.” Survival or\\nwinning may be success in the midst of competition, combat, or trauma, but\\nwhen the immediacy of that threat is removed, merely surviving is not living. As\\nI mentioned earlier, love and belonging are irreducible needs of men, women,\\nand children, and love and belonging are impossible to experience without\\nvulnerability. Living without connection—without knowing love and belonging\\n—is not victory. Fear and scarcity fuel the Viking-or-Victim approach and part of\\nreintegrating vulnerability means examining shame triggers; what’s fueling the\\nwin-or-lose fear? The men and women who made the shift from this paradigm to\\nWholeheartedness all talked about cultivating trust and connection in\\nrelationships as a prerequisite for trying on a less-combative way of engaging\\nwith the world.\\nAs far as connection and the military is concerned, I’m not advocating for a\\nkinder, gentler fighting force—I understand the realities faced by nations and the\\nsoldiers who protect them. What I am advocating is a kinder, gentler public, one\\nwilling to embrace, support, and reach out to the men and women we pay to be\\ninvulnerable on our behalf. Are we willing to reach out and connect?\\nA great example of how connection can heal and transform is the work being\\ndone by Team Red, White and Blue (TeamRWB.org). According to their mission\\nstatement, they believe the most effective way to impact a veteran’s life is\\nthrough a meaningful relationship with someone in their community. Their\\nprogram pairs wounded veterans with local volunteers. Together, they share\\nmeals, attend the veteran’s medical appointments, go to local sporting events,\\nand engage in other social activities. This interaction allows veterans to grow in\\ntheir community, meet supportive people, and find new passions in life.\\nMy interest in this work not only stemmed from my research, but also from an\\nextraordinary experience I had working with a group of veterans and military\\nfamily members on a shame resilience project in one of my classes at the\\nUniversity of Houston. It changed my life. It made me realize how much we, the\\npublic, can do for veterans, and why our politics and beliefs about war shouldn’t\\nstop us from reaching out to them with vulnerability, compassion, and\\nconnection. I will always be grateful for that experience and for what I’ve\\nlearned interviewing veterans about their experiences. For many of us who\\ngrieve over the wounds of war, we’re missing an opportunity for healing that’s\\nright in front of us. Team RWB’s motto, It’s Our Turn!, is a call to action for all\\nof us who want to do something to support vets. I’m working with them now and\\nI invite everyone to find a way to reach out. Dare greatly and take actions that\\ncommunicate to veterans or military families that they are not alone. Actions\\nthat communicate, “Your struggle is my struggle. Your trauma is my trauma.\\nYour healing is my healing.”\\nTRAUMA AND DARING GREATLY\\nWe all struggle to understand why some people who have survived trauma—be\\nit combat, domestic violence, sexual or physical abuse, or the quieter but equally\\ndevastating covert traumas of oppression, neglect, isolation, or living in extreme\\nfear or stress—exhibit tremendous resilience and lead full, Wholehearted lives,\\nwhile others become defined by their trauma. They may become perpetrators\\nthemselves of the violence they suffered, they struggle with addiction, or they’re\\nunable to escape the feeling that they are victims in situations where they’re not.\\nAfter studying shame for six years, I knew that part of the answer was shame\\nresilience—the people with the most resilience intentionally cultivated the four\\nelements that we discussed in the earlier chapters. The other part of the answer\\nfelt elusive to me until I started my new research interviewing people about\\nWholeheartedness and vulnerability. Then it made perfect sense. If we’re forced\\ninto seeing the world through the Viking-or-Victim lens as a survival\\nmechanism, then it can feel impossible or even deadly to let go of that\\nworldview. How can we expect someone to give up a way of seeing and\\nunderstanding the world that has physically, cognitively, or emotionally kept\\nthem alive? None of us is ever able to part with our survival strategies without\\nsignificant support and the cultivation of replacement strategies. Putting down\\nthe Viking-or-Victim shield often requires help from a professional—someone\\nwho understands trauma. Groups are also very helpful.\\nThe research participants who survived trauma and are living Wholehearted\\nlives spoke passionately about the need to:\\nAcknowledge the problem;\\nSeek professional help and/or support;\\nWork through the accompanying shame and secrecy;\\nAnd approach the reintegration of vulnerability as a daily practice rather\\nthan a checklist item.\\nAnd while the importance of spirituality saturated all of the interviews with\\nthe Wholehearted, it emerged as especially important with the participants who\\nconsider themselves not only trauma survivors, but also “thrivers.”\\nTHE SHIELD: LETTING IT ALL HANG OUT\\nI see two forms of oversharing in our culture. The first is what I call\\nfloodlighting, and the other is the smash and grab.\\nAs we discussed in the chapter on vulnerability myths, oversharing is not\\nvulnerability. In fact, it often results in disconnection, distrust, and\\ndisengagement.\\nTHE SHIELD: FLOODLIGHTING\\nTo understand floodlighting, we have to see that the intentions behind this kind\\nof sharing are multifaceted and often include some combination of soothing\\none’s pain, testing the loyalty and tolerance in a relationship, and/or hot-wiring a\\nnew connection (“We’ve only known each other for a couple of weeks, but I’m\\ngoing to share this and we’ll be BFFs now”). Unfortunately for all of us who’ve\\ndone this (and I include myself in this group), the response is normally the\\nopposite of what we’re looking for: People recoil and shut down, compounding\\nour shame and disconnection. You can’t use vulnerability to discharge your own\\ndiscomfort, or as a tolerance barometer in a relationship (“I’ll share this and see\\nif you stick around”), or to fast-forward a relationship—it just won’t cooperate.\\nOrdinarily, when we reach out and share ourselves—our fears, hopes,\\nstruggles, and joy—we create small sparks of connection. Our shared\\nvulnerability creates light in normally dark places. My metaphor for this is\\ntwinkle lights (I keep them in my house year-round as a reminder).\\nThere’s something magical about the idea of twinkle lights shining in dark and\\ndifficult places. The lights are small, and a single light is not very special, but an\\nentire strand of sparkling lights is sheer beauty. It’s the connectivity that makes\\nthem beautiful. When it comes to vulnerability, connectivity means sharing our\\nstories with people who have earned the right to hear them—people with whom\\nwe’ve cultivated relationships that can bear the weight of our story. Is there\\ntrust? Is there mutual empathy? Is there reciprocal sharing? Can we ask for what\\nwe need? These are the crucial connection questions.\\nWhen we share vulnerability, especially shame stories, with someone with\\nwhom there is no connectivity, their emotional (and sometimes physical)\\nresponse is often to wince, as if we have shone a floodlight in their eyes. Instead\\nof a strand of delicate lights, our shared vulnerability is blinding, harsh, and\\nunbearable. If we are on the receiving end, our hands fly up and cover our faces,\\nwe squeeze our entire faces (not just our eyes) shut, and we look away. When it’s\\nover, we feel depleted, confused, and sometimes even manipulated. Not exactly\\nthe empathic response that those telling the story were hoping for. Even for those\\nof us who study empathy and teach empathy skills, it’s rare that we’re able to\\nstay attuned when someone’s oversharing has stretched us past our connectivity\\nwith them.\\nDARING GREATLY: CLARIFYING INTENTIONS,\\nSETTING BOUNDARIES, AND CULTIVATING\\nCONNECTION\\nMuch of the beauty of light owes its existence to the dark. The most powerful\\nmoments of our lives happen when we string together the small flickers of light\\ncreated by courage, compassion, and connection and see them shine in the\\ndarkness of our struggles. That darkness is lost when we use vulnerability to\\nfloodlight our listener, and the response is disconnection. We then use this\\ndisconnection as verification that we’ll never find comfort, that we’re not\\nworthy, that the relationship is no good, or, in the case of oversharing to hot-wire\\na connection, that we’ll never have the intimacy that we crave. We think,\\n“Vulnerability is a crock. It’s not worth it and I’m not worth it.” What we don’t\\nsee is that using vulnerability is not the same thing as being vulnerable; it’s the\\nopposite—it’s armor.\\nSometimes we’re not even aware that we’re oversharing as armor. We can\\npurge our vulnerability or our shame stories out of total desperation to be heard.\\nWe blurt out something that is causing us immense pain because we can’t bear\\nthe thought of holding it in for one more second. Our intentions may not be\\npurging or blurting to armor ourselves or push others away, but that’s the exact\\noutcome of our behaviors. Whether we’re on the purging end or the receiving\\nend of this experience, self-compassion is critical. We have to give ourselves a\\nbreak when we share too much too soon, and we have to practice self-kindness\\nwhen we feel like we weren’t able to hold space for someone who hit us with the\\nfloodlight. Judgment exacerbates disconnection.\\nHearing this, sometimes people ask me how I decide what to share and how to\\nshare it when it comes to my own work. I share a lot of myself in my work, after\\nall, and I certainly haven’t cultivated trusting relationships with all of you or all\\nof the people in the audiences where I speak. It’s an important question, and the\\nanswer is that I don’t tell stories or share vulnerabilities with the public until I’ve\\nworked through them with the people I love. I have my own boundaries around\\nwhat I share and what I don’t share and I stay mindful of my intentions.\\nFirst, I only share stories or experiences that I’ve worked through and feel that\\nI can share from solid ground. I don’t share what I define as “intimate” stories,\\nnor do I share stories that are fresh wounds. I did that once or twice early in my\\ncareer and it was pretty terrible. There’s nothing like staring into an audience of\\na thousand people who are all giving you the floodlight look.\\nSecond, I follow the rule that I learned in my graduate social work training.\\nSharing yourself to teach or move a process forward can be healthy and\\neffective, but disclosing information as a way to work through your personal\\nstuff is inappropriate and unethical. Last, I only share when I have no unmet\\nneeds that I’m trying to fill. I firmly believe that being vulnerable with a larger\\naudience is only a good idea if the healing is tied to the sharing, not to the\\nexpectations I might have for the response I get.\\nWhen I asked other people who share their stories through blogs, books, and\\npublic speaking about this, it turns out that they are very similar in their\\napproaches and intentions. I don’t want the fear of floodlighting to stop anyone\\nfrom sharing their struggles with the world, but being mindful about what, why,\\nand how we share is important when the context is a larger public. We’re all\\ngrateful for people who write and speak in ways that help us remember that\\nwe’re not alone.\\nIf you recognize yourself in this shield, this checklist might help:\\nWhy am I sharing this?\\nWhat outcome am I hoping for?\\nWhat emotions am I experiencing?\\nDo my intentions align with my values?\\nIs there an outcome, response, or lack of a response that will hurt my feelings?\\nIs this sharing in the service of connection?\\nAm I genuinely asking the people in my life for what I need?\\nTHE SHIELD: THE SMASH AND GRAB\\nIf floodlighting is about misusing vulnerability, the second form of oversharing\\nis all about using vulnerability as a manipulation tool. A smash-and-grab job is\\nwhere a burglar smashes in a door or a store window and grabs what s/he can;\\nit’s sloppy, unplanned, and desperate. The smash and grab used as vulnerability\\narmor is about smashing through people’s social boundaries with intimate\\ninformation, then grabbing whatever attention and energy you can get your\\nhands on. We see this most often in celebrity culture, where sensationalism\\nthrives.\\nUnfortunately, teachers and school administrators have told me that they see\\nthis same smash-and-grab behavior in students as young as middle school kids.\\nUnlike floodlighting, which at least comes from a place of needing confirmation\\nof our worthiness, this purported disclosure of vulnerability feels less real. I\\nhaven’t interviewed enough people who engage in this behavior to fully\\nunderstand the motivation, but what’s emerged so far is attention seeking. Of\\ncourse, worthiness issues can and do underpin attention seeking, but in our social\\nmedia world, it’s increasingly difficult to determine what’s a real attempt to\\nconnect and what’s performance. The only thing I do know is that it’s not\\nvulnerability.\\nDARING \\nGREATLY: \\nQUESTIONING\\nINTENTIONS\\nThis self-exposure instead feels one-directional, and for those who engage in it\\nan audience appears to be more desirable than intimate connection. If we find\\nourselves engaging in a smash and grab, I think the reality-check questions are\\nthe same as the ones in the section on floodlighting. I think it’s also important to\\nask, “What need is driving this behavior?” and “Am I trying to reach, hurt, or\\nconnect with someone specifically, and is this the right way to do it?”\\nTHE SHIELD: SERPENTINING\\nI’m not someone who typically enjoys slapstick humor or screwball comedies. I\\nmuch prefer a good romantic comedy or one of those painfully slow, character-\\ndriven Miramax movies. That makes the movie clip that I’m using as the\\nmetaphor for this particular vulnerability protection mechanism seem odd. But\\nhonestly, every time I watch this movie, I laugh so hard that my face hurts. Just\\nthinking about it makes me start laughing.\\nThe movie is the 1979 comedy The In-Laws, starring Peter Falk and Alan\\nArkin. On the eve of their children’s wedding, dentist Sheldon Kornpett (played\\nby Alan Arkin) meets Vince Ricardo (played by Peter Falk). Sheldon is the\\nbride’s father, and Vince is the groom’s. Arkin’s character is an anxious,\\nregimented, straitlaced dentist. Falk’s character is a CIA operative who appears\\nto have gone rogue and who thinks nothing of car chases and shootouts. As\\nyou’ve probably guessed, the lovable but reckless agent drags the unsuspecting\\ndentist into his far-flung misadventures.\\nThe movie is really corny, but Peter Falk is brilliant as the outrageous agent\\nand Alan Arkin is the perfect uptight straight man. My very favorite scene is\\nwhen Falk tells a terrified Arkin to avoid a flurry of bullets by running in a\\nzigzag pattern. They’re totally exposed on an airport runway while being shot at\\nby multiple snipers, and his best advice is “Serpentine, Shel! Serpentine!” At one\\npoint, the dentist miraculously makes it to shelter, but then remembers that he\\ndidn’t serpentine, so he runs back into the line of fire so he can zigzag his way\\nback to cover. I’m totally into this, so I put the two-minute clip on my website.\\nScroll \\ndown \\nto \\nthe \\nbottom \\nof \\nthe \\npage \\nand \\nyou’ll \\nsee \\nit\\n(http://www.brenebrown.com/videos).\\nI don’t know why it cracks me up, but I laugh out loud every time I see it.\\nMaybe it’s the visual of a wild-eyed Peter Falk running back and forth, yelling,\\n“Serpentine!” Maybe it’s because I remember watching it with my dad and\\nbrother and falling out. To this day if things are getting tense in a family\\nconversation, one of us will nonchalantly say, “Serpentine,” and we’ll all laugh.\\nSerpentining is the perfect metaphor for how we spend enormous energy\\ntrying to dodge vulnerability when it would take far less effort to face it straight\\non. The image also conveys how fruitless it is to think of zigzagging in the face\\nof something as expansive and all-consuming as vulnerability.\\n“Serpentining” means trying to control a situation, backing out of it,\\npretending it’s not happening, or maybe even pretending that you don’t care. We\\nuse it to dodge conflict, discomfort, possible confrontation, the potential for\\nshame or hurt, and/or criticism (self- or other-inflicted). Serpentining can lead to\\nhiding out, pretending, avoidance, procrastination, rationalizing, blaming, and\\nlying.\\nI have a tendency to want to serpentine when I feel vulnerable. If I have to\\nmake a difficult call, I’ll try to script both sides of it, I’ll convince myself that I\\nshould wait, I’ll draft an e-mail while telling myself that it’s better in writing,\\nand I’ll think of a million other things to do. I’ll emotionally run back and forth\\nuntil I’m exhausted.\\nDARING GREATLY: BEING PRESENT, PAYING\\nATTENTION, MOVING FORWARD\\nWhen I catch myself trying to zigzag my way out of vulnerability, it always\\nhelps to have Peter Falk’s voice in my head shouting, “Serpentine, Shel!” It\\nmakes me laugh, which forces me to breathe. Breathing and humor are great\\nways to reality-check our behaviors and to start engaging with vulnerability.\\nSerpentining is draining, and running back and forth to avoid something is not\\na good way to live. As I was trying to come up with occasions when serpentining\\nmight be useful, I thought about the advice that I once received from an old guy\\nwho lived in a Louisiana swamp. My parents took my brother and me to fish in\\nthe channels running through some swampland owned by the company my dad\\nworked for in New Orleans. The man who let us onto the property said, “If a\\ngator comes atcha, run a zigzag pattern—they’re quick but they ain’t good at\\nmaking turns.”\\nWell, a gator did lunge out of the water and ate the end off my mom’s fishing\\npole, but we never were chased. And, as it turns out, the whole thing is a myth\\nanyway. According to the experts at the San Diego Zoo, we can easily outrun an\\nalligator, zigzagging or not. They max out at a speed of around ten or eleven\\nmiles per hour, and more importantly, they can’t run very far. They depend on\\nsurprise attacks, not chasing down their prey. In that sense they’re very much\\nlike the gremlins that live in the shame swamplands and keep us from being\\nvulnerable. So, we don’t need to serpentine; we just need to be present, pay\\nattention, and move forward.\\nTHE SHIELD: CYNICISM, CRITICISM, COOL,\\nAND CRUELTY\\nIf you decide to walk into the arena and dare greatly, you’re going to get kicked\\naround. It doesn’t matter if your arena is politics or the PTO, or if your great dare\\nis an article for your school newsletter, a promotion, or selling a piece of pottery\\non Etsy—you’re going to be on the receiving end of some cynicism and\\ncriticism before it’s over. There may even be some plain ol’ mean-spiritedness.\\nWhy? Because cynicism, criticism, cruelty, and cool are even better than armor\\n—they can be fashioned into weapons that not only keep vulnerability at a\\ndistance but also can inflict injury on the people who are being vulnerable and\\nmaking us uncomfortable.\\nIf we are the kind of people who “don’t do vulnerability,” there’s nothing that\\nmakes us feel more threatened and more incited to attack and shame people than\\nto see someone daring greatly. Someone else’s daring provides an uncomfortable\\nmirror that reflects back our own fears about showing up, creating, and letting\\nourselves be seen. That’s why we come out swinging. When we see cruelty,\\nvulnerability is likely to be the driver.\\nWhen I say criticism, I don’t mean productive feedback, debate, and\\ndisagreement over the value or importance of a contribution. I’m talking about\\nput-downs, personal attacks, and unsubstantiated claims about our motivations\\nand intentions.\\nWhen I talk about cynicism, I don’t mean healthy skepticism and questioning.\\nI’m talking about the reflexive cynicism that leads to mindless responses like\\n“That’s so stupid,” or “What a loser idea.” Cool is one of the most rampant\\nforms of cynicism. Whatever. Totally Lame. So uncool. Who gives a shit?\\nAmong some folks it’s almost as if enthusiasm and engagement have become a\\nsign of gullibility. Being too excited or invested makes you lame. A word that\\nwe’ve banned in our house along with loser and stupid.\\nIn the introduction to the Chapter I talked about adolescence as the starting\\nline for the race to the armory. Cynicism and cool are currency of the realm in\\nmiddle and high school. Every single student in my daughter’s middle school\\nwears a hoodie every single day (even when it’s 95 degrees outside). Not only do\\nthese jackets shield vulnerability by being the ultimate in cool accessories, but\\nI’m pretty sure the kids think of them as invisibility cloaks. They literally\\ndisappear inside them. They’re a way to hide. When the hoods are up and the\\nhands are hidden in the pocket, they scream disengagement. Too cool to care.\\nAs adults, we can also protect ourselves from vulnerability with cool. We\\nworry about being perceived as laughing too loud, buying in, caring too much,\\nbeing too eager. We don’t wear hoodies as often, but we can use our titles,\\neducation, background, and positions as handles on the shields of criticism,\\ncynicism, cool, and cruelty: I can talk to you this way or blow you off because of\\nwho I am or what I do for a living. And, make no mistake, when it comes to this\\nshield, handles are also fashioned out of nonconformity and rejection of\\ntraditional status markers: I dismiss you because you’ve sold out and you spend\\nyour life in a cubicle or I’m more relevant and interesting because I rejected the\\ntrappings of higher education, traditional employment, etc.\\nDARING GREATLY: TIGHTROPE WALKING,\\nPRACTICING \\nSHAME \\nRESILIENCE, \\nAND\\nREALITY CHECKING\\nOver the course of one year, I interviewed artists, writers, innovators, business\\nleaders, clergy, and community leaders about these issues, and how they stayed\\nopen to the constructive (albeit difficult-to-hear) criticism while filtering out the\\nmean-spirited attacks. Basically I wanted to know how they maintained the\\ncourage to keep on walking into the arena. I’ll confess that I was motivated by\\nmy own struggle to learn how to keep daring.\\nWhen we stop caring about what people think, we lose our capacity for\\nconnection. When we become defined by what people think, we lose our\\nwillingness to be vulnerable. If we dismiss all the criticism, we lose out on\\nimportant feedback, but if we subject ourselves to the hatefulness, our\\nspirits get crushed. It’s a tightrope, shame resilience is the balance bar, and\\nthe safety net below is the one or two people in our lives who can help us\\nreality-check the criticism and cynicism.\\nI’m very visual, so I have a picture of a person on a tightrope hanging over my\\ndesk to remind me that working to stay open and at the same time to keep\\nboundaries in place is worth the energy and risk. I actually used a Sharpie to\\nwrite this across the balance bar: “Worthiness is my birthright.” It’s both a\\nreminder to practice shame resilience and a touchstone of my spiritual beliefs.\\nAnd in case I’m feeling more ornery than usual, I have a little Post-it Note under\\nmy tightrope picture that reads, “Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit.” That’s\\nalso a touchstone of my spiritual beliefs.\\nThe research participants who had used criticism and cynicism in the past as a\\nway to protect themselves from vulnerability had some very powerful wisdom to\\nshare about their transition to Wholeheartedness. Many of them said that they\\ngrew up with parents who modeled that behavior and that they weren’t aware of\\nhow fully they had mimicked it until they started investigating their own fear of\\nbeing vulnerable, trying new things, and engaging. These folks were not\\negomaniacs who took pleasure in cutting down other people; in fact, they were\\nconsistently harder on themselves than they were on other people. So their\\nmean-spiritedness wasn’t only directed outward, even if they admitted that they\\noften used it to lessen their own self-doubt.\\nThe first sentence of the “daring greatly” quote from Theodore Roosevelt says\\na lot: “It’s not the critic who counts.” And for the men and women I interviewed\\nwho defined themselves as that critic, the “not counting” was definitely felt.\\nThey often struggled with feeling dismissed and invisible in their own lives.\\nCriticizing was a way to be heard. When I asked how they moved from hurtful\\ncriticism to constructive criticism and from cynicism to contribution, they\\ndescribed a process that mirrored shame resilience: understanding what triggered\\ntheir attack, what it means about their own sense of self-worth, talking to people\\nthey trust about it, and asking for what they need. Many of these folks had to dig\\ndeep about the cool issue. How did being perceived as cool become a driving\\nvalue and what was the cost of pretending that things didn’t matter?\\nThe fear of being vulnerable can unleash cruelty, criticism, and cynicism in all\\nof us. Making sure we take responsibility for what we say is one way that we can\\ncheck our intentions. Dare greatly and put your name on your posted comments\\nonline. If you don’t feel comfortable owning it, then don’t say it. And if you’re\\nreading this and you have control over online sites that allow comments, then\\nyou should dare greatly and make users sign in and use real names, and hold the\\ncommunity responsible for creating a respectful environment.\\nIn addition to walking the tightrope, practicing shame resilience, and\\ncultivating a safety-net community that supports me when I’m feeling attacked\\nor hurt, I’ve implemented two additional strategies. The first is simple: I only\\naccept and pay attention to feedback from people who are also in the arena. If\\nyou’re occasionally getting your butt kicked as you respond, and if you’re also\\nfiguring out how to stay open to feedback without getting pummeled by insults,\\nI’m more likely to pay attention to your thoughts about my work. If, on the other\\nhand, you’re not helping, contributing, or wrestling with your own gremlins, I’m\\nnot at all interested in your commentary.\\nThe second strategy is also simple. I carry a small sheet of paper in my wallet\\nthat has written on it the names of people whose opinions of me matter. To be on\\nthat list, you have to love me for my strengths and struggles. You have to know\\nthat I’m trying to be Wholehearted, but I still cuss too much, flip people off\\nunder the steering wheel, and have both Lawrence Welk and Metallica on my\\niPod. You have to know and respect that I’m totally uncool. There’s a great quote\\nfrom the movie Almost Famous that says, “The only true currency in this\\nbankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you’re uncool.”\\nTo be on my list, you have to be what I call a “stretch-mark friend”—our\\nconnection has been stretched and pulled so much that it’s become part of who\\nwe are, a second skin, and there are a few scars to prove it. We’re totally uncool\\nwith each other. I don’t think anyone has more than one or two people who\\nqualify for that list. The important thing is not to discount the stretch-mark\\nfriends to gain the approval of the strangers who are being mean and nasty or are\\ntoo cool. Nothing serves as a better reminder of that than the immortal words of\\nmy friend Scott Stratten, author of UnMarketing: “Don’t try to win over the\\nhaters; you’re not the jackass whisperer.”\\nCHAPTER 5\\nMIND THE GAP:\\nCULTIVATING CHANGE\\nAND CLOSING THE\\nDISENGAGEMENT DIVIDE\\nMinding the gap is a daring strategy. We have to pay attention to the space between where we’re actually standing and where\\nwe want to be. More importantly, we have to practice the values that we’re holding out as important in our culture. Minding\\nthe gap requires both an embrace of our own vulnerability and cultivation of shame resilience—we’re going to be called upon\\nto show up as leaders and parents and educators in new and uncomfortable ways. We don’t have to be perfect, just engaged\\nand committed to aligning values with action.\\nMIND the Gap” first appeared in 1969 on the London Underground as a\\nwarning to train passengers to be careful while stepping over the gap between\\nthe train door and the station platform. It has since become the name of a band\\nand a movie, and the phrase has been captured on everything from T-shirts to\\ndoormats. In our house we have a small, framed “Mind the Gap” postcard that\\nreminds us to pay attention to the space between where we’re standing and\\nwhere we want to go. Let me explain.\\nSTRATEGY VERSUS CULTURE\\nIn the business world, there’s an ongoing debate about the relationship between\\nstrategy and culture, and the relative importance of each. Just to define the terms,\\nI think of strategy as “the game plan,” or the detailed answer to the question\\n“What do we want to achieve and how are we going to get there?” We all—\\nfamilies, religious groups, project teams, teachers from the kindergarten cluster\\n—have game plans. And we all think about the goals we want to accomplish and\\nthe steps we need to take to be successful.\\nCulture, on the other hand, is less about what we want to achieve and more\\nabout who we are. Out of the many complex definitions of culture, including\\nthose that weighed down my undergrad sociology textbooks, the one that\\nresonates the most with me is the simplest. As organizational development\\npioneers Terrence Deal and Allan Kennedy explained it: “Culture is the way we\\ndo things around here.” I like this definition because it rings true for discussions\\nabout all cultures—from the larger culture of scarcity that I write about in the\\nfirst chapter, to a specific organizational culture, to the culture that defines my\\nfamily.\\nSome form of the debate about what’s more important, strategy or culture,\\nbubbles up in every conversation I have with leaders. One camp subscribes to\\nthe famous quote often attributed to thought leader Peter Drucker: “Culture eats\\nstrategy for breakfast.” Other folks believe that pitting one against the other\\ncreates a false dichotomy and that we need both. Interestingly, I’ve yet to find a\\nstrong argument that strategy is more important than culture. I think everyone\\nagrees in theory that “who we are” is at least as important as “what we want to\\nachieve.”\\nWhile some complain that the debate is old, and too chicken-or-the-egg to be\\nhelpful, I think it’s a critically relevant discussion for organizations. Maybe more\\nimportantly, I think examining these issues can transform families, schools, and\\ncommunities.\\n“The way we do things around here,” or culture, is complex. In my\\nexperience, I can tell a lot about the culture and values of a group, family, or\\norganization by asking these ten questions:\\n1. What behaviors are rewarded? Punished?\\n2. Where and how are people actually spending their resources (time, money,\\nattention)?\\n3. What rules and expectations are followed, enforced, and ignored?\\n4. Do people feel safe and supported talking about how they feel and asking\\nfor what they need?\\n5. What are the sacred cows? Who is most likely to tip them? Who stands the\\ncows back up?\\n6. What stories are legend and what values do they convey?\\n7. What happens when someone fails, disappoints, or makes a mistake?\\n8. How is vulnerability (uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure) perceived?\\n9. How prevalent are shame and blame and how are they showing up?\\n10. What’s the collective tolerance for discomfort? Is the discomfort of\\nlearning, trying new things, and giving and receiving feedback normalized,\\nor is there a high premium put on comfort (and how does that look)?\\nIn each of the following sections I’ll talk about how these play out in our lives\\nand what specifically I look for, but first I want to talk about where this line of\\nquestioning leads us.\\nAs someone who studies culture as a whole, I think the power of these\\nquestions is their ability to shed light on the darkest areas of our lives:\\ndisconnection, disengagement, and our struggle for worthiness. Not only do\\nthese questions help us understand the culture, they surface the discrepancies\\nbetween “what we say” and “what we do,” or between the values we espouse\\nand the values we practice. My dear friend Charles Kiley uses the term\\n“aspirational values” to describe the elusive list of values that reside in our best\\nintentions, on the wall of our cubical, at the heart of our parenting lectures, or in\\nour company’s vision statement. If we want to isolate the problems and develop\\ntransformation strategies, we have to hold our aspirational values up against\\nwhat I call our practiced values—how we actually live, feel, behave, and think.\\nAre we walking our talk? Answering this can get very uncomfortable.\\nTHE DISENGAGEMENT DIVIDE\\nHere’s my theory: Disengagement is the issue underlying the majority of\\nproblems I see in families, schools, communities, and organizations and it takes\\nmany forms, including the ones we discussed in the “Armory” chapter. We\\ndisengage to protect ourselves from vulnerability, shame, and feeling lost and\\nwithout purpose. We also disengage when we feel like the people who are\\nleading us—our boss, our teachers, our principal, our clergy, our parents, our\\npoliticians—aren’t living up to their end of the social contract.\\nPolitics is a great, albeit painful, example of social contract disengagement.\\nPoliticians on both sides of the aisle are making laws that they’re not required to\\nfollow or that don’t affect them, they’re engaging in behaviors that would result\\nin most of us getting fired, divorced, or arrested. They’re espousing values that\\nare rarely displayed in their behavior. And just watching them shame and blame\\neach other is degrading for us. They’re not living up to their side of the social\\ncontract and voter turnout statistics show that we’re disengaging.\\nReligion is another example of social contract disengagement. First,\\ndisengagement is often the result of leaders not living by the same values they’re\\npreaching. Second, in an uncertain world, we often feel desperate for absolutes.\\nIt’s the human response to fear. When religious leaders leverage our fear and\\nneed for more certainty by extracting vulnerability from spirituality and turning\\nfaith into “compliance and consequences,” rather than teaching and modeling\\nhow to wrestle with the unknown and how to embrace mystery, the entire\\nconcept of faith is bankrupt on its own terms. Faith minus vulnerability equals\\npolitics, or worse, extremism. Spiritual connection and engagement is not built\\non compliance, it’s the product of love, belonging, and vulnerability.\\nSo, here’s the question: We don’t intentionally create cultures in our families,\\nschools, communities, and organizations that fuel disengagement and\\ndisconnection, so how does it happen? Where’s the gap?\\nThe gap starts here: We can’t give people what we don’t have. Who we are\\nmatters immeasurably more than what we know or who we want to be.\\nThe space between our practiced values (what we’re actually doing, thinking,\\nand feeling) and our aspirational values (what we want to do, think, and feel) is\\nthe value gap, or what I call “the disengagement divide.” It’s where we lose our\\nemployees, our clients, our students, our teachers, our congregations, and even\\nour own children. We can take big steps—we can even make a running jump to\\ncross the widening value fissures that we face at home, work, and school—but at\\nsome point, when that divide broadens to a certain critical degree, we’re goners.\\nThat’s why dehumanizing cultures foster the highest levels of disengagement—\\nthey create value gaps that actual humans can’t hope to successfully navigate.\\nLet’s take a look at some common issues that arise in the context of families.\\nI’m using family examples because we’re all part of families. Even if we don’t\\nhave children, we were raised by adults. In each case a significant gap has grown\\nbetween the practiced values and the aspirational values, creating that dangerous\\ndisengagement divide.\\n1. Aspirational values: Honesty and Integrity\\nPracticed values: Rationalizing and letting things slide\\nMom is always telling her kids that honesty and integrity are important, and\\nthat stealing and cheating in school won’t be tolerated. As they pile into the\\ncar after a long grocery shop, Mom realizes that the cashier didn’t charge\\nher for the sodas in the bottom of the cart. Rather than going back into the\\nstore, she shrugs and says, “Wasn’t my fault. They’re making a mint\\nanyway.”\\n2. Aspirational values: Respect and Accountability\\nPracticed value: Fast and easy is more important\\nDad is always driving home the importance of respect and accountability,\\nbut when Bobby intentionally breaks Sammy’s new Transformer, Dad is too\\nbusy on his BlackBerry to sit down with the brothers and talk about how\\nthey should treat each other’s toys. Instead of insisting that Bobby needs to\\napologize and make amends, he shrugs his shoulders, thinking, Boys will be\\nboys, and tells them both to go to their rooms.\\n3. Aspirational values: Gratitude and Respect\\nPracticed values: Teasing, taking for granted, disrespect\\nMom and Dad constantly feel underappreciated, and they’re tired of their\\nchildren’s disrespectful attitudes. But Mom and Dad themselves yell at each\\nother and call each other names. No one in the house says please or thank\\nyou, including the parents. Moreover, Mom and Dad use put-downs with\\ntheir children and with each other, and everyone routinely teases family\\nmembers to the point of tears. The problem is that the parents are looking\\nfor behaviors, emotions, and thinking patterns that their children have never\\nseen modeled.\\n4. Aspirational Value: Setting Limits\\nPracticed Values: Rebellion and cool are important\\nJulie is seventeen and her younger brother, Austin, is fourteen. Julie and\\nAustin’s parents have a zero-tolerance policy for cigarettes, alcohol, and\\ndrugs. Unfortunately, that policy isn’t working. Both kids have been caught\\nsmoking, and Julie has just been suspended because her teacher found\\nvodka in her water bottle at school. Julie looks at her parents and screams,\\n“You’re such hypocrites! What about those wild parties y’all used to throw\\nin high school? What about that time when Mom went to jail? Y’all thought\\nthat was so funny when you told us! You even showed us pictures.”\\nNow, let’s take a look at the power of aligned values:\\n1. Aspirational Values: Emotional Connection and Honored Feelings\\nPracticed Values: Emotional Connection and Honored Feelings\\nMom and Dad have tried to instill and model a “feelings first” ethic in their\\nfamily. One evening Hunter comes home from basketball practice and is\\nclearly upset. His sophomore year has been tough, and the basketball coach\\nis really riding him. He throws his bag down on the kitchen floor and heads\\nstraight upstairs. Mom and Dad are in the kitchen making dinner, and they\\nwatch Hunter as he disappears up to his room. Dad turns off the burner, and\\nMom tells Hunter’s younger brother that they’re going to talk to Hunter and\\nto please give them some time alone with him. They go upstairs together\\nand sit on the edge of his bed. “Your mom and I know these past few weeks\\nhave been really hard,” Dad says. “We don’t know exactly how you feel,\\nbut we want to know. High school was tough for both of us, and we want to\\nbe with you in this.” This was such a great example of minding the gap and\\ncultivating engagement! In the interview the father told me that it made all\\nof them feel very vulnerable and that they were all crying before it was over.\\nHe said that sharing his high school struggles with his son really opened\\nthe relationship between them.\\nI want to stress that these examples aren’t fiction; they’re from the data. And,\\nno, we can’t be perfect models all of the time. I know I can’t. But when our\\npracticed values are routinely in conflict with the expectations we set in our\\nculture, disengagement is inevitable. If Mom is exhausted after the grocery shop\\nand drives away without paying once, it might not be a big deal. If “I can get\\naway with it and it’s not my fault” is her norm, she needs to adjust her\\nexpectations around her kids’ cheating. If she drives away without paying but\\nthen sits her kids down and says, “I should have gone back in and paid for the\\nsoda. It doesn’t matter whose fault it was. I’m going back to the store today”—\\nwell, that’s incredibly powerful. The lesson here is “I do want to live by my\\nvalues and it’s okay to be imperfect and make mistakes in this house. We just\\nneed to make it right when we can.”\\nThe example about the vodka illustrates a common struggle I hear from\\nparents all of the time. “I was wild,” they say. “I did things I don’t want my kids\\nto do. Should I lie about my escapades?” As a former wild person, I don’t think\\nthe issue is whether to lie or not to lie. It’s about what we share and how we\\nshare it. First, not everything we do or did is our children’s business. Just as,\\nwhen they’re adults, not everything they do is our business. So we should\\nexamine the motivation for sharing a particular story and let the question about\\nwhat we’re teaching drive our decision. Second, having an honest talk with our\\nkids about drugs and alcohol, and our experiences with either or both, can be\\nhelpful. But framing our numbing or party experiences as cool war stories and\\nplacing importance on being rebellious may eventually be at odds with the\\nvalues we want our children to develop.\\nRemember the debate about culture and strategy? I think both are important\\nand I think we need daring strategies to develop daring cultures. As these\\nexamples of aspirational values versus practiced values demonstrate, if we want\\nto reconnect and reengage, we have to mind the gap.\\nMinding the gap is a daring strategy. We have to pay attention to the space\\nbetween where we’re actually standing and where we want to be. More\\nimportantly, we have to practice the values that we’re holding out as important in\\nour culture. Minding the gap requires both an embrace of our own vulnerability\\nand cultivation of shame resilience—we’re going to be called upon to show up\\nas leaders and parents and educators in new and uncomfortable ways. We don’t\\nhave to be perfect, just engaged and committed to aligning values with action.\\nWe also need to be prepared: The gremlins will be out in full force, as they love\\nto sneak up just when we’re about to step into the arena, be vulnerable, and take\\nsome chances.\\nIn the next two chapters, I’m going to use the concepts I’ve introduced here to\\njump right in and tell you what I think we need to do both to cultivate\\nengagement and to transform the way we parent, educate, and lead. These three\\nquestions will guide the following chapters:\\n1. How does the culture of “never enough” affect our schools, organizations,\\nand families?\\n2. How do we recognize and combat shame at work, school, and home?\\n3. What does minding the gap and daring greatly look like in schools,\\norganizations, and families?\\nCHAPTER 6\\nDISRUPTIVE\\nENGAGEMENT:\\nDARING TO REHUMANIZE EDUCATION\\nAND WORK\\nTo reignite creativity, innovation, and learning, leaders must rehumanize education and work. This means understanding how\\nscarcity is affecting the way we lead and work, learning how to engage with vulnerability, and recognizing and combating\\nshame. Make no mistake: honest conversations about vulnerability and shame are disruptive. The reason that we’re not having\\nthese conversations in our organizations is that they shine light in dark corners. Once there is language, awareness, and\\nunderstanding, turning back is almost impossible and carries with it severe consequences. We all want to dare greatly. If you\\ngive us a glimpse into that possibility, we’ll hold on to it as our vision.\\nIt can’t be taken away.\\nBefore we start this chapter, I want to clarify what I mean by “leader.” I’ve\\ncome to believe that a leader is anyone who holds her- or himself accountable\\nfor finding potential in people and processes. The term leader has nothing to do\\nwith position, status, or number of direct reports. I wrote this chapter for all of us\\n—parents, teachers, community volunteers, and CEOs—anyone who is willing\\nto dare greatly and lead.\\nTHE CHALLENGE OF LEADING\\nIN A CULTURE OF “NEVER ENOUGH”\\nIn 2010 I had the opportunity to spend a long weekend with fifty CEOs from\\nSilicon Valley. One of the other speakers at the retreat was Kevin Surace, the\\nthen CEO of Serious Materials, and Inc. magazine’s 2009 Entrepreneur of the\\nYear. I knew Kevin was going to speak about disruptive innovation so in my first\\nconversation with him, before either one of us had spoken to the group and\\nbefore he knew about my work, I asked him this question: What’s the most\\nsignificant barrier to creativity and innovation?\\nKevin thought about it for a minute and said, “I don’t know if it has a name,\\nbut honestly, it’s the fear of introducing an idea and being ridiculed, laughed at,\\nand belittled. If you’re willing to subject yourself to that experience, and if you\\nsurvive it, then it becomes the fear of failure and the fear of being wrong. People\\nbelieve they’re only as good as their ideas and that their ideas can’t seem too\\n‘out there’ and they can’t ‘not know’ everything. The problem is that innovative\\nideas often sound crazy and failure and learning are part of revolution. Evolution\\nand incremental change is important and we need it, but we’re desperate for real\\nrevolution and that requires a different type of courage and creativity.”\\nBefore that conversation I had never specifically asked the leaders I’d\\ninterviewed about innovation, but everything Kevin was saying fit with my data\\non work and education. I smiled and responded, “It’s true, isn’t it? Most people\\nand most organizations can’t stand the uncertainty and the risk of real\\ninnovation. Learning and creating are inherently vulnerable. There’s never\\nenough certainty. People want guarantees.”\\nHe simply said, “Yes. Again, I’m not sure if there’s a name for the problem,\\nbut something related to fear keeps people from going for it. They focus on what\\nthey already do well and they don’t put themselves out there.” There was a slight\\npause in our conversation before he looked at me and said, “So, I understand\\nyou’re a researcher. What exactly do you do?”\\nI chuckled. “I study that something related to fear—I’m a shame-and-\\nvulnerability researcher.”\\nWhen I got back to my hotel room I grabbed my research journal and made\\nnotes about my conversation with Kevin. As I thought about that something\\nrelated to fear, I remembered another set of notes that I had written in that same\\njournal. I flipped back until I found the field notes that I had taken after talking\\nto a group of middle school students about their classroom experiences. When I\\nasked them to describe the key to learning, one girl gave the following reply\\nwhile the others passionately nodded their heads and said, “Yes! That’s it!” and\\n“Exactly.”\\n“There are times when you can ask questions or challenge ideas, but if you’ve\\ngot a teacher that doesn’t like that or the kids in the class make fun of people\\nwho do that, it’s bad. I think most of us learn that it’s best to just keep your head\\ndown, your mouth shut, and your grades high.”\\nAs I reread this passage in my notes and thought about my conversation with\\nKevin, I was overwhelmed. As a teacher I felt heartbreak—we can’t learn when\\nour heads are down and our mouths are shut. As a mother of a middle school\\nstudent and a kindergartener, I found it infuriating. As a researcher, it was the\\nmoment when I started to realize how often the struggles of our education\\nsystem and the challenges we face in our workplaces mirror each other.\\nI first envisioned this as two separate discussions—one for educators and one\\nfor leaders. But as I looked back on the data, I realized that teachers and school\\nadministrators are leaders. C-level executives, managers, and supervisors are\\nteachers. No corporation or school can thrive in the absence of creativity,\\ninnovation, and learning, and the greatest threat to all three of these is\\ndisengagement.\\nGiven what I’ve learned from the research, and what I’ve observed over the\\npast couple of years as I’ve worked with leaders from schools and companies of\\nall sizes and types, I believe we have to completely reexamine the idea of\\nengagement. I call it disruptive engagement for this reason. To reignite\\ncreativity, innovation, and learning, leaders must rehumanize education and\\nwork. This means understanding how scarcity is affecting the way we lead and\\nwork, learning how to engage with vulnerability, and recognizing and combating\\nshame.\\nSir Ken Robinson speaks to the power of making this shift in his appeal to\\nleaders to replace the outdated idea that human organizations should work like\\nmachines with a metaphor that captures the realities of humanity. In his book\\nOut of Our Minds: Learning to be Creative, Robinson writes, “However\\nseductive the machine metaphor may be for industrial production, human\\norganizations are not actually mechanisms and people are not components in\\nthem. People have values and feelings, perceptions, opinions, motivations, and\\nbiographies, whereas cogs and sprockets do not. An organization is not the\\nphysical facilities within which it operates; it is the networks of people in it.”\\nMake no mistake: Rehumanizing work and education requires courageous\\nleadership. Honest conversations about vulnerability and shame are disruptive.\\nThe reason that we’re not having these conversations in our organizations is that\\nthey shine light in the dark corners. Once there is language, awareness, and\\nunderstanding, turning back is almost impossible and carries with it severe\\nconsequences. We all want to Dare Greatly. If you give us a glimpse into that\\npossibility, we’ll hold on to it as our vision. It can’t be taken away.\\nRECOGNIZING AND COMBATING SHAME\\nShame breeds fear. It crushes our tolerance for vulnerability, thereby killing\\nengagement, innovation, creativity, productivity, and trust. And worst of all, if\\nwe don’t know what we’re looking for, shame can ravage our organizations\\nbefore we see one outward sign of a problem. Shame works like termites in a\\nhouse. It’s hidden in the dark behind the walls and constantly eating away at our\\ninfrastructure, until one day the stairs suddenly crumble. Only then do we realize\\nthat it’s only a matter of time before the walls come tumbling down.\\nIn the same way that a casual walk around our house won’t reveal a termite\\nproblem, a stroll through an office or a school won’t necessarily reveal a shame\\nproblem. Or at least we hope it’s not that obvious. If it is—if we see a manager\\nberating an employee or a teacher shaming a student—the problem is already\\nacute and more than likely has been happening for a long time. In most cases,\\nthough, we have to know what we’re looking for when we assess an organization\\nfor signs that shame may be an issue.\\nSIGNS THAT SHAME HAS PERMEATED THE\\nCULTURE\\nBlaming, gossiping, favoritism, name-calling, and harassment are all behavior\\ncues that shame has permeated a culture. A more obvious sign is when shame\\nbecomes an outright management tool. Is there evidence of people in leadership\\nroles bullying others, criticizing subordinates in front of colleagues, delivering\\npublic reprimands, or setting up reward systems that intentionally belittle,\\nshame, or humiliate people?\\nI’ve never been to a shame-free school or organization. I’m not saying it\\ndoesn’t exist, but I doubt it. In fact, once I’ve explained how shame works, I\\nnormally have one or two teachers approach me and explain that they use shame\\non a daily basis. Most ask how to change that practice, but a few proudly say, “It\\nworks.” The best-case scenario is that it’s a limited or contained problem, rather\\nthan a cultural norm. One reason that I’m confident that shame exists in schools\\nis simply because 85 percent of the men and women we interviewed for the\\nshame research could recall a school incident from their childhood that was so\\nshaming, it changed how they thought of themselves as learners. What makes\\nthis even more haunting is that approximately half of those recollections were\\nwhat I refer to as creativity scars. The research participants could point to a\\nspecific incident where they were told or shown that they weren’t good writers,\\nartists, musicians, dancers, or something creative. I still see this happening in\\nschools all of the time. Art is graded on narrow standards and kids as young as\\nkindergarten are told they have creative gifts. This helps explain why the\\ngremlins are so powerful when it comes to creativity and innovation.\\nCorporations have their own struggles. The Workplace Bullying Institute\\n(WBI) defines bullying as “Repeated mistreatment: sabotage by others that\\nprevented work from getting done, verbal abuse, threatening conduct,\\nintimidation, and humiliation.” A 2010 poll conducted by Zogby International\\nfor WBI reported that an estimated 54 million American workers (37 percent of\\nthe US workforce) have been bullied at work. Furthermore, another WBI report\\nrevealed that 52.5 percent of the time, bullied workers reported that employers\\nbasically did nothing to stop the bullying.\\nWhen we see shame being used as a management tool (again, that means\\nbullying, criticism in front of colleagues, public reprimands, or reward systems\\nthat intentionally belittle people), we need to take direct action because it means\\nthat we’ve got an infestation on our hands. And we need to remember that this\\ndoesn’t just happen overnight. Equally important to keep in mind is that shame is\\nlike the other “sh” word. Like shit, shame rolls downhill. If employees are\\nconstantly having to navigate shame, you can bet that they’re passing it on to\\ntheir customers, students, and families.\\nSo, if it’s happening and it can be isolated to a specific unit, work team, or\\nperson, it has to be addressed immediately and without shame. We learn shame\\nin our families of origin, and many people grow up believing that it’s an\\neffective and efficient way to manage people, run a classroom, and parent. For\\nthat reason, shaming someone who’s using shame is not helpful. But doing\\nnothing is equally dangerous, not only for the people who are targets of the\\nshaming but also for the entire organization.\\nSeveral years ago a man came up to me after an event and said, “Interview\\nme! Please! I’m a financial advisor and you wouldn’t believe what happens in\\nmy office.” When I met Don for the interview, he told me that in his organization\\nyou choose your office each quarter based on your quarterly results: The person\\nwith the best results chooses first and sends the person in the desired office\\npacking.\\nHe shook his head, and his voice cracked a bit when he said, “Given that I’ve\\nhad the best numbers for the past six quarters, you’d think I’d like that. But I\\ndon’t. I absolutely hate it. It’s a miserable environment.” He then told me how\\nafter the previous quarterly results were in, his boss walked into his office,\\nclosed the door, and told him that he had to move offices.\\n“At first I thought my numbers had dropped. Then he told me that he didn’t\\ncare if I had the best numbers or if I liked my office; the point was to terrorize\\nthe other guys. He said, ‘Busting their balls in public builds character. It’s\\nmotivating.’”\\nBefore the end of our interview, he told me he was job hunting. “I’m good at\\nmy job and even enjoy it, but I didn’t sign up to terrorize people. I never knew\\nwhy it felt so shitty, but after hearing you talk, now I do. It’s shame. It’s worse\\nthan high school. I’ll find a better place to work, and you can be damn sure that\\nI’m taking my clients with me.”\\nIn I Thought It Was Just Me, I tell the following story about Sylvia, an event\\nplanner in her thirties who jumped right into our interview by saying, “I wish\\nyou could have interviewed me six months ago. I was a different person. I was\\nso stuck in shame.” When I asked her what she meant, she explained that she\\nhad heard about my research from a friend and volunteered to be interviewed\\nbecause she felt her life had been changed by shame. She had recently had an\\nimportant breakthrough when she found herself on the “losers’ list” at work.\\nApparently, after two years of what her employer called “outstanding,\\nwinners’ work,” she had made her first big mistake. The mistake cost her agency\\na major client. Her boss’s response was to put her on the “losers’ list.” She said,\\n“In one minute I went from being on the winners’ board to being at the top of the\\nlosers’ list.” I guess I must have winced when Sylvia referred to the “losers’ list”\\nbecause, without my remarking at all, she said, “I know, it’s terrible. My boss\\nhas these two big dry-erase boards outside of his office. One’s the winners’ list,\\nand one board is for the losers.” She said for weeks she could barely function.\\nShe lost her confidence and started missing work. Shame, anxiety, and fear took\\nover. After a difficult three-week period, she quit her job and went to work for\\nanother agency.\\nShame can only rise so far in any system before people disengage to\\nprotect themselves. When we’re disengaged, we don’t show up, we don’t\\ncontribute, and we stop caring. On the far end of the spectrum, disengagement\\nallows people to rationalize all kinds of unethical behavior including lying,\\nstealing, and cheating. In the case of Don and Sylvia, they didn’t just disengage;\\nthey quit and took their talent to competitors.\\nAs we assess our organizations for signs of shame, it’s also important to be\\naware of external threats—forces outside of our organizations that are\\ninfluencing how both leaders and employees feel about their work. As a teacher,\\nthe sister of two public school teachers, and the sister-in-law of a public high\\nschool vice-principal, I don’t have to look far for examples of this.\\nSeveral years ago my sister Ashley called me crying. When I asked her what\\nwas wrong, she told me that the Houston Chronicle had published the name of\\nevery schoolteacher in the Houston Independent School District along with the\\nbonus they received based on their students’ standardized test scores. I hadn’t\\nseen the paper that day and I was stunned. And I was also confused.\\n“Ashley, you teach kindergarten. Your kids don’t take the tests yet. Is your\\nname in there?”\\nAshley explained that her name was in there and that the paper reported that\\nshe got the lowest bonus available. What they didn’t report was that it was the\\nhighest bonus available to kindergarten teachers. Imagine doing that—reporting\\neveryone’s salaries or bonuses and moreover reporting them inaccurately—to\\nany other group of professionals.\\n“I’m in a total shame meltdown,” Ashley said, still crying. “All I’ve ever\\nwanted to do was to be a teacher. I work my butt off. I’ve hit up everyone in our\\nfamily for money so I can buy school supplies for the kids who can’t afford\\nthem. I stay after and help the parents help their kids. I don’t get it. There are\\nhundreds of teachers like me, and do you read about that in the paper? No. And\\nit’s not just about me. Some of the very best teachers I know volunteer to teach\\nsome of the most challenging students without any thought about how it’s going\\nto affect their scores or bonuses. They do it because they love their work and\\nthey believe in the kids.”\\nUnfortunately, the “Scarlet Letter” approach to teacher evaluation is not just\\nhappening in Texas—it’s become an accepted practice across the nation. The\\ngood news is that people are finally daring greatly and speaking up. In response\\nto the New York State Court of Appeals ruling that teachers’ individual\\nperformance assessments could be made public, Bill Gates wrote this in a New\\nYork Times op-ed: “Developing a systematic way to help teachers get better is\\nthe most powerful idea in education today. The surest way to weaken it is to\\ntwist it into a capricious exercise in public shaming. Let’s focus on creating a\\npersonnel system that truly helps teachers improve.”\\nWhen I posted Gates’s op-ed on my Facebook page, many teachers left\\ncomments. I was moved by this response from a veteran teacher: “For me,\\nteaching is about love. It is not about transferring information, but rather creating\\nan atmosphere of mystery and imagination and discovery. When I begin to lose\\nmyself because of some unresolved pain or fears or the overpowering feelings of\\nshame, then I no longer teach…I deliver information and I think I become\\nirrelevant then.”\\nTeachers are not the only ones who wrestle with shame delivered (usually in\\nthe public media) from outside of the organization. I’m often asked to address\\nthis issue when I’m speaking with professionals who are routinely vilified,\\ndisliked, or misunderstood by the public—lawyers, dentists, and folks from the\\nfinancial industry are a few. We might roll our eyes and think, C’mon, we love to\\nhate them! But I can tell you from my experiences that it’s not fun to feel hated\\nsimply for doing work that means something to you, and it can take a serious toll\\non individuals and cultures.\\nAs leaders, the most effective thing we can do when this kind of media abuse\\nis happening is speak out, insist on accuracy and accountability, and confront it\\nhead on with the people affected by it. We can’t pretend that it’s not hurting our\\nemployees. On a personal level, we can resist buying into and perpetuating the\\npublic stereotyping of professions that by their nature operate in realms of\\npersonal stress.\\nTHE BLAME GAME\\nHere’s the best way to think about the relationship between shame and blame: If\\nblame is driving, shame is riding shotgun. In organizations, schools, and\\nfamilies, blaming and finger-pointing are often symptoms of shame. Shame\\nresearchers June Tangney and Ronda Dearing explain that in shame-bound\\nrelationships, people “measure carefully, weigh, and assign blame.” They write,\\n“In the face of any negative outcome, large or small, someone or something must\\nbe found responsible (and held accountable). There’s no notion of ‘water under\\nthe bridge.’” They go on to say, “After all, if someone must be to blame and it’s\\nnot me, it must be you! From blame comes shame. And then hurt, denial, anger,\\nand retaliation.”\\nBlame is simply the discharging of pain and discomfort. We blame when\\nwe’re uncomfortable and experience pain—when we’re vulnerable, angry, hurt,\\nin shame, grieving. There’s nothing productive about blame, and it often\\ninvolves shaming someone or just being mean. If blame is a pattern in your\\nculture, then shame needs to be addressed as an issue.\\nCOVER-UP CULTURE\\nRelated to blame is the issue of cover-ups. Just like blame is a sign of shame-\\nbased organizations, cover-up cultures depend on shame to keep folks quiet.\\nWhen the culture of an organization mandates that it is more important to protect\\nthe reputation of a system and those in power than it is to protect the basic\\nhuman dignity of individuals or communities, you can be certain that shame is\\nsystemic, money drives ethics, and accountability is dead. This is true in all\\nsystems, from corporations, nonprofits, universities, and governments, to\\nchurches, schools, families, and sports programs. If you think back on any major\\nincidents fueled by cover-ups, you’ll see this pattern.\\nIn an organizational culture where respect and the dignity of individuals are\\nheld as the highest values, shame and blame don’t work as management styles.\\nThere is no leading by fear. Empathy is a valued asset, accountability is an\\nexpectation rather than an exception, and the primal human need for belonging is\\nnot used as leverage and social control. We can’t control the behavior of\\nindividuals; however, we can cultivate organizational cultures where behaviors\\nare not tolerated and people are held accountable for protecting what matters\\nmost: human beings.\\nWe won’t solve the complex issues that we’re facing today without creativity,\\ninnovation, and engaged learning. We can’t afford to let our discomfort with the\\ntopic of shame get in the way of recognizing and combating it in our schools and\\nworkplaces. The four best strategies for building shame-resilient organizations\\nare:\\n1. Supporting leaders who are willing to dare greatly and facilitate honest\\nconversations about shame and cultivate shame-resilient cultures.\\n2. Facilitating a conscientious effort to see where shame might be functioning\\nin the organization and how it might even be creeping into the way we\\nengage with our co-workers and students.\\n3. Normalizing is a critical shame-resilience strategy. Leaders and managers\\ncan cultivate engagement by helping people know what to expect. What are\\ncommon struggles? How have other people dealt with them? What have\\nyour experiences been?\\n4. Training all employees on the differences between shame and guilt, and\\nteaching them how to give and receive feedback in a way that fosters\\ngrowth and engagement.\\nMINDING THE GAP WITH FEEDBACK\\nA daring greatly culture is a culture of honest, constructive, and engaged\\nfeedback. This is true in organizations, schools, and families. I know families\\nstruggle with this issue; however, I was shocked to see “lack of feedback”\\nemerge as a primary concern in the interviews that focused on work experiences.\\nToday’s organizations are so metric-focused in their evaluation of performance\\nthat giving, receiving, and soliciting valuable feedback ironically has become\\nrare. It’s even a rarity in schools where learning depends on feedback, which is\\ninfinitely more effective than grades scribbled on the top of a page or computer-\\ngenerated, standardized test scores.\\nThe problem is straightforward: Without feedback there can be no\\ntransformative change. When we don’t talk to the people we’re leading about\\ntheir strengths and their opportunities for growth, they begin to question their\\ncontributions and our commitment. Disengagement follows.\\nWhen I asked people why there was such a lack of feedback in their\\norganizations and schools, they used different language, but the two major issues\\nwere the same:\\n1. We’re not comfortable with hard conversations.\\n2. We don’t know how to give and receive feedback in a way that moves\\npeople and processes forward.\\nThe good news is that these are very fixable problems. If an organization\\nmakes the creation of a feedback culture a priority and a practice, rather than an\\naspirational value, it can happen. People are desperate for feedback—we all\\nwant to grow. We just need to learn how to give feedback in a way that inspires\\ngrowth and engagement.\\nRight off the bat, I believe that feedback thrives in cultures where the goal is\\nnot “getting comfortable with hard conversations” but normalizing discomfort. If\\nleaders expect real learning, critical thinking, and change, then discomfort\\nshould be normalized: “We believe growth and learning are uncomfortable so it’s\\ngoing to happen here—you’re going to feel that way. We want you to know that\\nit’s normal and it’s an expectation here. You’re not alone and we ask that you\\nstay open and lean into it.” This is true at all levels and in all organizations,\\nschools, faith communities, and even families. I’ve observed this pattern of\\nnormalized discomfort in the Wholehearted organizations I’ve researched and\\nI’ve lived it in my classroom and with my family.\\nI learned to teach by immersing myself in books on engaged and critical\\npedagogy by writers like bell hooks and Paulo Freire. At first, I was terrified by\\nthe idea that if education is going to be transformative, it’s going to be\\nuncomfortable and unpredictable. Now, as I begin my fifteenth year of teaching\\nat the University of Houston, I always tell my students, “If you’re comfortable,\\nI’m not teaching and you’re not learning. It’s going to get uncomfortable in here\\nand that’s okay. It’s normal and it’s part of the process.”\\nThe simple and honest process of letting people know that discomfort is\\nnormal, it’s going to happen, why it happens, and why it’s important, reduces\\nanxiety, fear, and shame. Periods of discomfort become an expectation and a\\nnorm. In fact, most semesters I have students who approach me after class and\\nsay, “I haven’t been uncomfortable yet. I’m concerned.” These exchanges often\\nlead to critically important conversations and feedback about their engagement\\nand my teaching. The big challenge for leaders is getting our heads and hearts\\naround the fact that we need to cultivate the courage to be uncomfortable and to\\nteach the people around us how to accept discomfort as a part of growth.\\nFor the best guidance on how to give feedback that moves people and\\nprocesses forward, I turn to my social work roots. In my experience the heart of\\nvaluable feedback is taking the “strengths perspective.” According to social\\nwork educator Dennis Saleebey, viewing performance from the strengths\\nperspective offers us the opportunity to examine our struggles in light of our\\ncapacities, talents, competencies, possibilities, visions, values, and hopes. This\\nperspective doesn’t dismiss the serious nature of our struggles; however, it does\\nrequire us to consider our positive qualities as potential resources. Dr. Saleebey\\nproposes, “It is as wrong to deny the possible as it is to deny the problem.”\\nOne effective method for understanding our strengths is to examine the\\nrelationship between strengths and limitations. If we look at what we do best as\\nwell as what we want to change the most, we will often find that the two are\\nvarying degrees of the same core behavior. Most of us can go through the\\nmajority of our “faults” or “limitations” and find strengths lurking within.\\nFor example, I can beat myself up for being too controlling and\\nmicromanaging, or I can recognize that I’m very responsible, dependable, and\\ncommitted to quality work. The micromanaging issues don’t go away, but by\\nviewing them from a strengths perspective, I have the confidence to look at\\nmyself and assess the behaviors I’d like to change.\\nI want to emphasize that the strengths perspective is not a tool to simply allow\\nus to put a positive spin on a problem and consider it solved. But by first\\nenabling us to inventory our strengths, it suggests ways we can use those\\nstrengths to address the related challenges. One way I teach this perspective to\\nstudents is by requiring them to give and receive feedback on their classroom\\npresentations. When a student presents, s/he receives feedback from every one of\\nhis or her classmates. The students in the audience have to identify three\\nobservable strengths and one opportunity for growth. The trick is that they have\\nto use their assessment of the strengths to make a suggestion on how the\\nindividual might address the specified opportunity. For example:\\nStrengths\\n1. You captured my interest right away with your emotional personal story.\\n2. You used examples that are relevant to my life.\\n3. You concluded with actionable strategies that tied in with our learning in\\nthe class.\\nOpportunity\\nYour stories and examples made me feel connected to you and what you were saying, but I sometimes struggled to read the\\nPowerPoint and listen to you at the same time. I didn’t want to miss anything you were saying, but I worried about not\\nfollowing the slides. You might experiment with fewer words on the slides—or maybe even no slides. You had me without\\nthem.\\nThe research has made this clear: Vulnerability is at the heart of the\\nfeedback process. This is true whether we give, receive, or solicit feedback.\\nAnd the vulnerability doesn’t go away even if we’re trained and experienced in\\noffering and getting feedback. Experience does, however, give us the advantage\\nof knowing that we can survive the exposure and uncertainty, and that it’s worth\\nthe risk.\\nOne of the greatest mistakes that I see people make in the feedback process is\\n“armoring up.” To protect ourselves from the vulnerability of giving or receiving\\nfeedback, we get ready to rumble (cue Jock Jams). It’s easy to assume that the\\nfeedback process only feels vulnerable for the person receiving the feedback, but\\nthat’s not true. Honest engagement around expectations and behavior is always\\nfraught with uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure for everyone involved.\\nHere’s an example. Susan, the principal of a large high school, has to talk to one\\nof her teachers about several parent complaints. The parents have voiced\\nconcerns about the teacher’s cursing during class and making personal calls on\\nher cell phone while she allows her students to leave the class, goof off, and\\nmake their own calls. In this situation “armoring up” can take several forms.\\nOne is that Susan can fill out the probation form and have it sitting on her\\ndesk when the teacher comes in. She’ll simply say, “Here’s the complaint. I’ve\\nwritten you up for the following offenses. Sign here and don’t let it happen\\nagain.” She’s knocked out the meeting in three minutes flat. There’s no\\nfeedback, no growth, no learning, but it’s over. The odds of the teacher changing\\nher behaviors are slim.\\nAnother way we armor up is by convincing ourselves that the other person\\ndeserves to be hurt or put down. Like most of us, Susan is more comfortable\\nwith anger than vulnerability, so she ratchets up her confidence with a little self-\\nrighteousness. “I’m so sick of this. If these teachers respected me, they’d never\\ndo stuff like this. I’ve had it. She’s been a problem since the first day I met her.\\nYou want to jack around in class—go for it. I’ll show you exactly how this\\nworks.” The opportunity for constructive feedback and relationship building\\nturns into a smackdown. Again, it’s over but there is no feedback, no growth, no\\nlearning and, more than likely, no change.\\nI’ll admit that I’ve got a lot of “bring it on” in me. I’m scrappy, I think fast on\\nmy feet, and I like my emotions with a little agency. I’m good at anger and only\\nso-so at vulnerability, so armoring up before a vulnerable experience is attractive\\nto me. Luckily, this work has taught me that when I feel self-righteous, it means\\nI’m afraid. It’s a way to puff up and protect myself when I’m afraid of being\\nwrong, making someone angry, or getting blamed.\\nSITTING ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE TABLE\\nIn my social work training, a lot of attention was paid to how we talk to people,\\neven down to where and how we sit. For example, I would never talk to a client\\nacross a desk; I would walk around my desk and sit in a chair across from the\\nclient so there was nothing big and bulky between us. I remember the first time I\\nwent in to see one of my social work professors about a grade. She got up from\\nbehind her desk and asked me to take a seat at a small round table she had in her\\noffice. She pulled up a chair and sat next to me.\\nIn armoring up for that conversation, I had pictured her sitting behind her big\\nmetal desk and me defiantly sliding my paper across it and demanding an\\nexplanation for my grade. After she sat down next to me, I put the paper on the\\ntable. As she said, “I’m so glad that you came in to talk to me about your paper.\\nYou did a great job on this; I loved your conclusion,” and patted me on the back,\\nI awkwardly realized that we were on the same side of the table.\\nTotally discombobulated, I blurted, “Thank you. I worked really hard on it.”\\nShe nodded and said, “I can tell. Thank you. I took some points off for your\\nAPA formatting. I’d like for you to focus on that and get it cleaned up. You could\\nsubmit this for publication, and I don’t want the reference formatting to hold you\\nback.”\\nI was still confused. She thinks it’s publishable? She liked it?\\n“Do you need some help with the APA formatting? It’s tricky and it took me\\nyears to get it down,” she asked. (A great example of normalizing.)\\nI told her that I’d fix the references and I asked her if she’d look at my\\nrevisions. She happily agreed and gave me a few tips on the process. I thanked\\nher for her time and left, grateful for my grade and for a teacher who cared as\\nmuch as she did.\\nToday, “Sitting on the same side of the table” is my metaphor for feedback. I\\nused it to create my Engaged Feedback Checklist:\\nI know I’m ready to give feedback when:\\nI’m ready to sit next to you rather than across from you;\\nI’m willing to put the problem in front of us rather than between us (or sliding it toward you);\\nI’m ready to listen, ask questions, and accept that I may not fully understand the issue;\\nI want to acknowledge what you do well instead of picking apart your mistakes;\\nI recognize your strengths and how you can use them to address your challenges;\\nI can hold you accountable without shaming or blaming you;\\nI’m willing to own my part;\\nI can genuinely thank you for your efforts rather than criticize you for your failings;\\nI can talk about how resolving these challenges will lead to your growth and opportunity; and\\nI can model the vulnerability and openness that I expect to see from you.\\nYou can find a printed copy of this checklist on my website (www.brenebrown.com).\\nHow would education be different if students, teachers, and parents sat on the\\nsame side of the table? How would engagement change if leaders sat down next\\nto folks and said, “Thank you for your contributions. Here’s how you’re making\\na difference. This issue is getting in the way of your growth, and I think we can\\ntackle it together. What ideas do you have about moving forward? What role do\\nyou think I’m playing in the problem? What can I do differently to support\\nyou?”\\nLet’s go back to the example with Susan, the principal who was armoring up\\nfor a smackdown. If she read through this checklist she’d realize that she’s not in\\na place to give feedback, to be a leader. But with parenting complaints stacking\\nup on her desk, time is an issue for her and she knows the situation needs to be\\naddressed. It can be very difficult to move into the right head and heart space to\\ngive feedback when we’re under pressure.\\nSo, how do we create a safe space for vulnerability and growth when we’re\\nnot feeling open? Armored feedback doesn’t facilitate lasting and meaningful\\nchange—I don’t know a single person who can be open to accepting feedback or\\nowning responsibility for something when they’re being hammered. Our\\nhardwiring takes over and we self-protect.\\nSusan’s best bet is to model the openness that she hopes to see, and solicit\\nfeedback from one of her colleagues. When I interviewed participants who\\nvalued feedback and worked at it, they talked about the necessity of soliciting\\nfeedback from their peers, asking for advice, and even role-playing difficult\\nsituations. If we’re not willing to ask for feedback and receive it, we’ll never be\\ngood at giving it. If Susan can work through her own feelings so that she can be\\npresent with her employee, she’s much more likely to see the change that she’s\\nrequesting.\\nSome of you might be wondering, “Susan’s employee problem is pretty\\nstraightforward and small. Why would she need to spend time soliciting\\nfeedback from one of her colleagues for a problem like that?” It’s a good\\nquestion with an important answer: The size, severity, or complexity of a\\nproblem doesn’t always reflect our emotional reactivity to it. If Susan can’t get\\nto the same side of the table with this teacher, it doesn’t matter how simple the\\nproblem is or how clear the violation is. What Susan might learn from her peer is\\nthat she’s really triggered by this particular teacher or that she’s armoring up\\nbecause unprofessional behavior is becoming a dangerous norm among this\\ncluster of teachers. Giving and soliciting feedback is about learning and growth,\\nand understanding who we are and how we respond to the people around us is\\nthe foundation in this process.\\nAgain, there’s no question that feedback may be one of the most difficult\\narenas to negotiate in our lives. We should remember, though, that victory is not\\ngetting good feedback, avoiding giving difficult feedback, or avoiding the need\\nfor feedback. Instead it’s taking off the armor, showing up, and engaging.\\nTHE COURAGE TO BE VULNERABLE\\nI recently gave a talk at the University of Houston’s Wolff Center for\\nEntrepreneurship. The program, which pairs thirty-five to forty elite\\nundergraduate students with mentors and offers comprehensive business\\ntraining, is ranked as the leading undergrad entrepreneurship program in the\\nUnited States. I was asked to talk to the students about vulnerability and the\\npower of story.\\nDuring the Q&A session after my talk, one of the students asked me a\\nquestion that I’m sure is often on the minds of people when I talk about\\nvulnerability. He said, “I can see how vulnerability is important, but I’m in sales\\nand I don’t get what that looks like. Does being vulnerable mean that if a\\ncustomer asks me a question about a product and I don’t know the answer, I just\\nsay what I’m thinking: ‘I’m new and I really don’t know what I’m doing?’”\\nThe students, who were all turned around listening to him, turned back in their\\nchairs and looked at me as if to say, “Yeah, that seems lame. Are we really\\nsupposed to do that?”\\nMy answer was no. And yes. In that scenario vulnerability is recognizing and\\nowning that you don’t know something; it’s looking the customer in the eye and\\nsaying, “I don’t know the answer to that, but I’ll find out. I want to make sure\\nyou have the correct information.” I explained that the unwillingness to engage\\nwith the vulnerability of not knowing often leads to making excuses, dodging the\\nquestion, or—worst-case scenario—bullshitting. That’s the deathblow in any\\nrelationship, and the one thing I’ve learned from talking to people who sell for a\\nliving is that sales is all about relationships.\\nSo, while I wouldn’t take that tack with the customer, I do think there’s some\\nvalue in sharing the feeling of not knowing what you’re doing with someone—\\nwhether a mentor who can offer support and guidance or a colleague who can\\nhelp you learn and normalize your experience. Imagine the stress and anxiety of\\nnot knowing what you’re doing, trying to convince a customer that you do, not\\nbeing able to ask for help, and not having anyone to talk to about your struggle.\\nThis is how we lose people. It’s too difficult to stay engaged in these\\ncircumstances. We start cutting corners, we stop caring, and we check out. After\\nmy talk, one of the mentors came up to me and said, “I’ve been in sales my\\nentire career, and let me tell you, there’s nothing more important than having the\\ncourage to say, ‘I don’t know,’ and ‘I messed up’—being honest and open is key\\nto success in every part of our lives.”\\nLast year I had the opportunity to interview Gay Gaddis, the owner and\\nfounder of T3 (The Think Tank) in Austin, Texas. T3 is a top integrated\\nmarketing firm that specializes in innovative marketing campaigns that cut\\nacross all media. In 1989, Gay cashed in a sixteen-thousand-dollar IRA with the\\ndream of starting an advertising agency. Twenty-three years after opening with a\\nhandful of regional accounts, Gay has built T3 into the nation’s largest\\nadvertising agency wholly owned by a woman. With offices in Austin, New\\nYork, and San Francisco, T3 works with clients including Microsoft, UPS,\\nJPMorgan Chase, Pfizer, Allstate, Coca-Cola, and Sprite. Her dynamic business\\nacumen and corporate culture have led to national recognition. She has been\\nnamed one of Fast Company’s Top 25 Women Business Builders, Inc.\\nmagazine’s Top 10 Entrepreneurs of the Year, and one of the top 25 Advertising\\nWorking Mothers of the Year by Working Mother magazine. Gay and T3’s\\nfamily-friendly workplace program, “T3 and Under,” was even recognized by\\nthe White House.\\nI jumped right into my interview with Gay by telling her that a business\\njournalist had recently told me that, unlike leaders in corporations who are\\nshielded by layers of systems, entrepreneurs can’t afford to be vulnerable. When\\nI asked her what she thought about that proposition, she smiled. “When you shut\\ndown vulnerability, you shut down opportunity.”\\nHere’s how she explained it: “By definition, entrepreneurship is vulnerable.\\nIt’s all about the ability to handle and manage uncertainty. People are constantly\\nchanging, budgets change, boards change, and competition means you have to\\nstay nimble and innovative. You have to create a vision and live up to that\\nvision. There is no vision without vulnerability.”\\nKnowing that Gay spends a considerable amount of time teaching and\\nmentoring, I asked her what advice she gives new entrepreneurs about\\nembracing uncertainty. She said, “Success requires entrepreneurs to cultivate\\nstrong support networks and good mentors. You need to learn how to shut out\\nthe noise so you can get clear on how you feel and what you think, and then you\\ndo the hard work. No question—it’s all about vulnerability.”\\nAnother great example of the power of vulnerability—this time in a\\ncorporation—is the leadership approach taken by Lululemon’s CEO, Christine\\nDay. In a video interview with CNN Money, Day explained that she was once a\\nvery bright, smart executive who “majored in being right.” Her transformation\\ncame when she realized that getting people to engage and take ownership wasn’t\\nabout “the telling” but about letting them come into the idea in a purpose-led\\nway, and that her job was creating the space for others to perform. She\\ncharacterized this change as the shift from “having the best idea or problem\\nsolving” to “being the best leader of people.”\\nThe shift she described is the shift from controlling to engaging with\\nvulnerability—taking risks and cultivating trust. And while vulnerability can\\nsometimes make us feel powerless, her shift was a total power move. Day has\\nincreased the number of stores from 71 to 174, while total revenue has grown\\nfrom $297 million to almost $1 billion, and Lululemon’s stock is up about 300\\npercent since its 2007 IPO.\\nIn a written interview with Day accompanying the video, the idea of\\nvulnerability as the birthplace of creativity, innovation, and trust continued to\\nplay out—even when it comes to failure and defeat. One of Day’s leadership\\nguideposts is “finding the magic makers.” As Day explained, “Taking\\nresponsibility, taking risks, and having an entrepreneurial spirit are qualities we\\nlook for in our employees. We want people who bring their own magic. Athletes\\nare great within our culture; they’re used to winning as well as losing. They\\nknow how to handle—and fix—defeat.” Day also emphasized the importance of\\nallowing people to make mistakes: “Our golden rule? If you screw up, you clean\\nit up.”\\nIn businesses, schools, faith communities—any system, even families—we\\ncan tell a lot about how people engage with vulnerability by observing how often\\nand how openly you hear people saying:\\n• I don’t know.\\n• I need help.\\n• I’d like to give it a shot.\\n• It’s important to me.\\n• I disagree—can we talk about it?\\n• It didn’t work, but I learned a lot.\\n• Yes, I did it.\\n• Here’s what I need.\\n• Here’s how I feel.\\n• I’d like some feedback.\\n• Can I get your take on this?\\n• What can I do better next time?\\n• Can you teach me how to do this?\\n• I played a part in that.\\n• I accept responsibility for that.\\n• I’m here for you.\\n• I want to help.\\n• Let’s move on.\\n• I’m sorry.\\n• That means a lot to me.\\n• Thank you.\\nFor leaders, vulnerability often looks and feels like discomfort. In his book\\nTribes: We Need You to Lead Us, Seth Godin writes, “Leadership is scarce\\nbecause few people are willing to go through the discomfort required to lead.\\nThis scarcity makes leadership valuable.…It’s uncomfortable to stand up in front\\nof strangers. It’s uncomfortable to propose an idea that might fail. It’s\\nuncomfortable to challenge the status quo. It’s uncomfortable to resist the urge to\\nsettle. When you identify the discomfort, you’ve found the place where a leader\\nis needed. If you’re not uncomfortable in your work as a leader, it’s almost\\ncertain you’re not reaching your potential as a leader.”\\nAs I looked over the data and read through my notes from the interviews I’ve\\ndone with leaders, I wondered what students would say to teachers and what\\nteachers would say to their principals if they had the opportunity to ask for the\\nleadership they needed. I wondered what the customer service representative\\nwould say to his boss and what she might ask of her boss. What do we want\\npeople to know about us and what do we need from them?\\nAs I started writing down the answers to these questions, I realized that they\\nsounded like a mandate; a manifesto. Here’s what emerged from these questions:\\nThe Daring Greatly\\nLeadership Manifesto\\nTo the CEOs and teachers. To the principals and the managers. To the politicians, community leaders, and decision-makers:\\nWe want to show up, we want to learn, and we want to inspire.\\nWe are hardwired for connection, curiosity, and engagement.\\nWe crave purpose, and we have a deep desire to create and contribute.\\nWe want to take risks, embrace our vulnerabilities, and be courageous.\\nWhen learning and working are dehumanized—when you no longer see us and no longer encourage our daring, or when\\nyou only see what we produce or how we perform—we disengage and turn away from the very things that the world needs\\nfrom us: our talent, our ideas, and our passion.\\nWhat we ask is that you engage with us, show up beside us, and learn from us.\\nFeedback is a function of respect; when you don’t have honest conversations with us about our strengths and our\\nopportunities for growth, we question our contributions and your commitment.\\nAbove all else, we ask that you show up, let yourself be seen, and be courageous. Dare Greatly with us.\\nYou can find a printed copy of this manifesto on my website (www.brenebrown.com).\\nCHAPTER 7\\nWHOLEHEARTED\\nPARENTING:\\nDARING TO BE THE ADULTS\\nWE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO BE\\nWho we are and how we engage with the world are much stronger predictors of how our children will do than what we know\\nabout parenting. In terms of teaching our children to dare greatly in the “never enough” culture, the question isn’t so much\\n“Are you parenting the right way?” as it is: “Are you the adult that you want your child to grow up to be?”\\nPARENTING IN A CULTURE OF NEVER\\nENOUGH\\nMost of us would love a color-coded parenting handbook that answers all of our\\nunanswerable questions, comes with guarantees, and minimizes our\\nvulnerability. We want to know that if we follow certain rules or adhere to the\\nmethod espoused by a certain parenting expert, our children will sleep through\\nthe night, be happy, make friends, achieve professional success, and stay safe.\\nThe uncertainty of parenting can bring up feelings in us that range from\\nfrustration to terror.\\nOur need for certainty in an endeavor as uncertain as raising children makes\\nexplicit “how-to-parent” strategies both seductive and dangerous. I say\\n“dangerous” because certainty often breeds absolutes, intolerance, and judgment.\\nThat’s why parents are so critical of one another—we latch on to a method or\\napproach and very quickly our way becomes the way. When we obsess over our\\nparenting choices to the extent that most of us do, and then see someone else\\nmaking different choices, we often perceive that difference as direct criticism of\\nhow we are parenting.\\nIronically, parenting is a shame and judgment minefield precisely because\\nmost of us are wading through uncertainty and self-doubt when it comes to\\nraising our children. After all, we rarely engage in self-righteous judgment when\\nwe feel confident about our decisions: I’m not going to practically knock myself\\nunconscious with a shaming eye roll about your nonorganic milk if I feel good\\nabout what I’m feeding my children. But if doubt lurks beneath my choices, that\\nself-righteous critic will spring to life in not-so-subtle parenting moments that\\nhappen because my underlying fear of not being the perfect parent is driving my\\nneed to confirm that, at the very least, I’m better than you.\\nSomewhere buried deep inside our hopes and fears for our children is the\\nterrifying truth that there is no such thing as perfect parenting and there are no\\nguarantees. From debates about attachment parenting and how much better they\\nparent in Europe to disparagement of “tiger moms” and helicopter parents, the\\nheated discussions that occupy much of the national parenting conversation\\nconveniently distract us from this important and difficult truth: Who we are and\\nhow we engage with the world are much stronger predictors of how our children\\nwill do than what we know about parenting.\\nI’m not a parenting expert. In fact, I’m not sure that I even believe in the idea\\nof “parenting experts.” I’m an engaged, imperfect parent and a passionate\\nresearcher. As I mentioned in the introduction, I’m an experienced mapmaker\\nand a stumbling traveler. Like many of you, parenting is by far my boldest and\\nmost daring adventure.\\nFrom the very beginning of my research on shame, I’ve always collected data\\non parenting and paid close attention to how research participants talked about\\nbeing parented and about parenting. The reason is simple: Our stories of\\nworthiness—of being enough—begin in our first families. The narrative\\ncertainly doesn’t end there, but what we learn about ourselves and how we learn\\nto engage with the world as children sets a course that either will require us to\\nspend a significant part of our life fighting to reclaim our self-worth or will give\\nus hope, courage, and resilience for our journey.\\nThere’s no question that our behavior, thinking, and emotions are both\\nhardwired within us and influenced by our environment. I wouldn’t hazard a\\nguess on the percentages, and I’m convinced that we’ll never have a precise\\nnature/nurture breakdown. I have no doubt, however, that when it comes to our\\nsense of love, belonging, and worthiness, we are most radically shaped by our\\nfamilies of origin—what we hear, what we are told, and perhaps most\\nimportantly, how we observe our parents engaging with the world.\\nAs parents, we may have less control than we think over temperament and\\npersonality, and less control than we want over the scarcity culture. But we do\\nhave powerful parenting opportunities in other areas: how we help our children\\nunderstand, leverage, and appreciate their hardwiring, and how we teach them\\nresilience in the face of relentless “never enough” cultural messages. In terms of\\nteaching our children to dare greatly in the “never enough” culture, the question\\nisn’t so much “Are you parenting the right way?” as it is: “Are you the adult that\\nyou want your child to grow up to be?”\\nAs Joseph Chilton Pearce writes, “What we are teaches the child more than\\nwhat we say, so we must be what we want our children to become.” Even though\\nthe vulnerability of parenting is terrifying at times, we can’t afford to armor\\nourselves against it or push it away—it is our richest, most fertile ground for\\nteaching and cultivating connection, meaning, and love.\\nVulnerability lies at the center of the family story. It defines our moments of\\ngreatest joy, fear, sorrow, shame, disappointment, love, belonging, gratitude,\\ncreativity, and everyday wonder. Whether we’re holding our children or standing\\nbeside them or chasing them down or talking through their locked door,\\nvulnerability is what shapes who we are and who our children are.\\nBy pushing away vulnerability, we turn parenting into a competition that’s\\nabout knowing, proving, executing, and measuring rather than being. If we put\\naside the question of “Who’s better?” and put down the yardsticks of school\\nadmissions, grades, sports, trophies, and accomplishments, I think the vast\\nmajority of us will agree that what we want for our children is what we want for\\nourselves—we want to raise children who live and love with their whole hearts.\\nIf Wholeheartedness is the goal, then above all else we should strive to raise\\nchildren who:\\nEngage with the world from a place of worthiness\\nEmbrace their vulnerabilities and imperfections\\nFeel a deep sense of love and compassion for themselves and others\\nValue hard work, perseverance, and respect\\nCarry a sense of authenticity and belonging with them, rather than\\nsearching for it in external places\\nHave the courage to be imperfect, vulnerable, and creative\\nDon’t fear feeling ashamed or unlovable if they are different or if they are\\nstruggling\\nMove through our rapidly changing world with courage and a resilient spirit\\nFor parents this means we are called upon to:\\nAcknowledge that we can’t give our children what we don’t have and so we\\nmust let them share in our journey to grow, change, and learn\\nRecognize our own armor and model for our children how to take it off, be\\nvulnerable, show up, and let ourselves be seen and known\\nHonor our children by continuing on our own journeys toward\\nWholeheartedness\\nParent from a place of “enough” rather than scarcity\\nMind the gap and practice the values we want to teach\\nDare greatly, possibly more than we’ve ever dared before\\nIn other words, if we want our children to love and accept who they are, our\\njob is to love and accept who we are. We can’t use fear, shame, blame, and\\njudgment in our own lives if we want to raise courageous children. Compassion\\nand connection—the very things that give purpose and meaning to our lives—\\ncan only be learned if they are experienced. And our families are our first\\nopportunities to experience these things.\\nIn this chapter, I want to share what I’ve learned about worthiness, shame\\nresilience, and vulnerability specifically from my parenting research. This work\\nhas profoundly transformed the way that Steve and I think and feel about\\nparenting. It has dramatically changed our priorities, our marriage, and our day-\\nto-day behaviors. Because Steve is a pediatrician, we spend lots of time\\ndiscussing parenting research and various parenting models. My goal here is not\\nto teach you how to parent, but to share what might be a new lens through which\\nto view the great dare of raising Wholehearted children.\\nUNDERSTANDING AND COMBATING SHAME\\nIt’s a terrible myth to believe that once we have children, our journey ends and\\ntheirs begins. For many of us, the most interesting and productive times in our\\nlives come after we have children. For the majority of us, the greatest challenges\\nand struggles also come in midlife and later. Wholehearted parenting is not\\nhaving it all figured out and passing it down—it’s learning and exploring\\ntogether. And trust me, there are times when my children are way ahead of me\\non the journey, either waiting for me or reaching back to pull me along.\\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, if you roughly divide the men and women\\nI’ve interviewed into two groups—those who feel a deep sense of love and\\nbelonging, and those who struggle for it—only one variable separates the\\ngroups: Those who feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging\\nsimply believe they are worthy of love and belonging. I often say that\\nWholeheartedness is like the North Star: We never really arrive, but we certainly\\nknow if we’re headed in the right direction. Raising children who believe in their\\nworthiness requires us to model that journey and that struggle.\\nThe important thing to know about worthiness is that it doesn’t have\\nprerequisites. Most of us, on the other hand, have a long list of worthiness\\nprerequisites—qualifiers that we’ve inherited, learned, and unknowingly picked\\nup along the way. Most of these prerequisites fall in the categories of\\naccomplishments, acquisitions, and external acceptance. It’s the if/when problem\\n(“I’ll be worthy when…” or “I’ll be worthy if…”). They may not be written\\ndown, and we may not even be aware of the prerequisites, but we all have a list\\nthat says, “I’ll be worthy…”\\nWhen I lose this weight\\nIf I get accepted into this school\\nIf my wife’s not cheating\\nIf we don’t get divorced\\nIf I get promoted\\nWhen I get pregnant\\nWhen he asks me out\\nWhen we buy a house in this neighborhood\\nIf no one finds out\\nShame loves prerequisites. Our if/when worthiness list easily doubles as the\\ngremlins’ to-do list. Don’t let her forget that her mom thinks she should lose that\\nbaby weight. Remind him that his new boss only respects guys with MBAs. Poke\\nher if she forgets that all of her friends made partner last year.\\nAs parents, we help our children develop shame resilience and worthiness by\\nstaying very mindful about the prerequisites that we’re knowingly or\\nunknowingly handing down to them. Are we sending them overt or covert\\nmessages about what makes them more and less lovable? Or are we focusing on\\nbehaviors that need to change and making it clear that their essential worthiness\\nis not on the table? I often tell parents that some of the most destructive covert\\nmessages that we send our children stem from the feminine and masculine norms\\nthat we discussed in Chapter 3. Are we overtly or covertly telling our daughters\\nthat thin, nice, and modest are prerequisites for worthiness? Are we teaching our\\ngirls to respect boys as tender and loving beings? Are we sending messages to\\nour sons that we expect them to be emotionally stoic, to put money and status\\nfirst, and to be aggressive? Are we teaching our sons to respect women and girls\\nas smart and capable people, not objects?\\nPerfectionism is another fount of prerequisites. In a dozen years of studying\\nworthiness, I’m convinced that perfectionism is actually contagious. If we\\nstruggle with being, living, and looking absolutely perfect, we might as well line\\nour children up and slip those little perfection straitjackets right over their heads.\\nJust as a reminder from Chapter 4, perfectionism is not teaching them how to\\nstrive for excellence or be their best selves. Perfectionism is teaching them to\\nvalue what other people think over what they think or how they feel. It’s\\nteaching them to perform, please, and prove. Unfortunately, I have many\\nexamples from my own life.\\nFor instance, when Ellen got her first tardy at school, she immediately broke\\ndown crying. She was so upset about breaking the rules and upsetting her teacher\\nor the principal that she just fell apart. We kept telling her that it wasn’t a big\\ndeal and that everyone is late sometimes until she felt better. That evening we\\ncelebrated surviving our first tardy with a little “tardy party” after dinner. She\\nfinally agreed that it wasn’t a big deal and that other people probably didn’t\\njudge her for being human.\\nFast-forward four days to Sunday morning. We’re running late for church and\\nI’m in tears. “Why can’t we ever get out of here on time! We’re going to be\\nlate!” Ellen looked up at me and earnestly asked, “Dad and Charlie will be here\\nin one minute. Are we missing something important?” Without hesitating, I said,\\n“No! I just hate walking in late and sneaking down the aisle. It’s the 9 o’clock\\nservice, not the 9:05 service.” She looked confused for a second, then grinned as\\nshe said, “It’s not a big deal. Everyone’s late sometimes. Remember? I’ll throw a\\ntardy party for you when we get home.”\\nSometimes prerequisites and perfectionism are handed down in very subtle\\nways. One of the very best pieces of parenting advice that I ever received was\\nfrom the writer Toni Morrison. It was May of 2000 and Ellen was just shy of her\\nfirst birthday. Ms. Morrison was on Oprah talking about her book The Bluest\\nEye. Oprah said, “Toni says a beautiful thing about the messages that we get\\nabout who we are when a child first walks into a room,” and she asked Ms.\\nMorrison to talk about it.\\nMs. Morrison explained that it’s interesting to watch what happens when a\\nchild walks into a room. She asked, “Does your face light up?” She explained,\\n“When my children used to walk in the room when they were little, I looked at\\nthem to see if they had buckled their trousers or if their hair was combed or if\\ntheir socks were up.…You think your affection and your deep love is on display\\nbecause you’re caring for them. It’s not. When they see you, they see the critical\\nface. What’s wrong now?” Her advice was simple, but paradigm-shifting for me.\\nShe said, “Let your face speak what’s in your heart. When they walk in the room\\nmy face says I’m glad to see them. It’s just as small as that, you see?”\\nI literally think about that advice every day—it’s become a practice. When\\nEllen comes bounding down the stairs dressed for school, I don’t want my first\\ncomment to be “Pull your hair back” or “Those shoes don’t match your dress.” I\\nwant my face to convey how happy I am to see her—to be with her. When\\nCharlie comes in the back door and he’s sweaty and dirty from catching lizards, I\\nwant to flash a smile before I say, “Don’t touch anything until you wash your\\nhands.” So often we think that we earn parenting points by being critical, put\\nout, and exasperated. Those first looks can be prerequisites or worthiness-\\nbuilders. I don’t want to criticize when my kids walk in the room, I want to light\\nup!\\nIn addition to keeping a mindful eye on prerequisites and perfectionism, we\\ncan help our children keep and cultivate their sense of worthiness in another\\nway, one that relates back to what we learned about the differences between\\nshame and guilt. Research indicates that parenting is a primary predictor of how\\nprone our children will be to shame or guilt. In other words, we have a lot of\\ninfluence over how our kids think about themselves and their struggles.\\nKnowing as we do that shame is positively correlated with addiction, depression,\\naggression, violence, eating disorders, and suicide, and that guilt is inversely\\ncorrelated with these outcomes, we naturally would want to raise children who\\nuse more guilt self-talk than shame.\\nThis means we need to separate our children from their behaviors. As it turns\\nout, there’s a significant difference between you are bad and you did something\\nbad. And, no, it’s not just semantics. Shame corrodes the part of us that believes\\nwe can do and be better. When we shame and label our children, we take away\\ntheir opportunity to grow and try on new behaviors. If a child tells a lie, she can\\nchange that behavior. If she is a liar—where’s the potential for change in that?\\nCultivating more guilt self-talk and less shame self-talk requires rethinking\\nhow we discipline and talk to our children. But it also means explaining these\\nconcepts to our kids. Children are very receptive to talking about shame if we’re\\nwilling to do it. By the time they’re four and five, we can explain to them the\\ndifference between guilt and shame, and how much we love them even when\\nthey make bad choices.\\nWhen Ellen was in kindergarten, her teacher called me at home one afternoon\\nand said, “I totally get what you do now.”\\nWhen I asked her why, she said that earlier in the week, she had looked over\\nat Ellen, who was in the “Glitter Center” and said, “Ellen! You’re a mess.”\\nApparently, Ellen got a very serious look on her face and said, “I may be making\\na mess, but I’m not a mess.” (That’s the day I became “that parent.”)\\nCharlie also gets the distinction between shame and guilt. When I found our\\ndog pulling food out of the trash can, I scolded her by saying, “Bad girl!”\\nCharlie came sliding around the corner, shouting, “Daisy is a good girl who\\nmade a bad choice! We love her! We just don’t love her choices!”\\nWhen I tried to explain the difference by saying, “Daisy is a dog, Charlie,” his\\nresponse was, “Oh, I see. Daisy is a good dog who made a bad choice.”\\nShame is so painful for children because it is inextricably linked to the fear of\\nbeing unlovable. For young children who are still dependent on their parents for\\nsurvival—for food, shelter, and safety—feeling unlovable is a threat to survival.\\nIt’s trauma. I’m convinced that the reason most of us revert back to feeling\\nchildlike and small when we’re in shame is because our brain stores our early\\nshame experiences as trauma, and when it’s triggered we return to that place. We\\ndon’t have the neurobiological research yet to confirm this, but I’ve coded\\nhundreds of interviews that follow this same pattern:\\n“I don’t know what happened. My boss called me an idiot in front of my team\\nand I couldn’t respond. All of a sudden I’m back in Mrs. Porter’s second-grade\\nclass and I’m speechless. I can’t come back with one decent response.”\\nOr\\n“My son struck out for the second time and I couldn’t see straight. I always\\nsaid I’d never do what my dad did to me, but there I was screaming at him in\\nfront of his teammates. I’m not even sure how it happened.”\\nIn Chapter 3 we learned that the brain processes social rejection or shame the\\nsame exact way it processes physical pain. I suspect we’ll eventually have the\\ndata to support my hypothesis about children storing shame as trauma, but in the\\nmeantime I can say without hesitation that childhood experiences of shame\\nchange who we are, how we think about ourselves, and our sense of self-\\nworth.\\nWe can work hard not to use shame as a parenting tool, but our children are\\nstill going to encounter shame in the outside world. The good news is that when\\nchildren understand the distinction between shame and guilt, and when they\\nknow that we’re interested and open to talking about these feelings and\\nexperiences, they are much more likely to talk to us about the shaming\\nexperiences they may encounter with teachers, coaches, clergy, babysitters,\\ngrandparents, and other adults who have influence in their lives. This is critically\\nimportant because it gives us the opportunity to “crop” shame the way we do\\nphotographs.\\nI often use a scrapbook as a metaphor to talk about the impact shame has on\\nchildren. As parents, once we learn about shame, we will more than likely\\nrealize that, yes, we’ve shamed our children. It happens. Even to shame\\nresearchers. Given the severity of the outcomes around shame, we’ll also begin\\nto worry that the shaming moments that happen outside our home will define our\\nchildren, despite our best efforts in the family. And those experiences will\\nhappen—name calling, put-downs, and teasing are rampant in our culture of\\ncruelty. The good news, however, is that we have a lot of influence over how\\nmuch power those experiences have in our children’s lives.\\nMost of us can remember shaming events from childhood that felt defining.\\nBut more than likely we remember them because we didn’t process those\\nexperiences with parents who were open to talking about shame and committed\\nto helping us cultivate shame resilience. I don’t blame my parents for that any\\nmore than I judge my grandmother letting me stand next to her in the front seat\\nwhile she was driving. They didn’t have access to the information we have\\ntoday.\\nKnowing what I do now, I think about shame and worthiness in this way: “It’s\\nthe album, not the picture.” If you imagine opening up a photo album, and many\\nof the pages are full of eight-by-ten photos of shaming events, you’ll close that\\nalbum and walk away thinking, Shame defines that story. If, on the other hand,\\nyou open that album and see a few small photos of shame experiences, but each\\none is surrounded by pictures of worthiness, hope, struggle, resilience, courage,\\nfailure, success, and vulnerability, the shame experiences are only a part of a\\nlarger story. They don’t define the album.\\nAgain, we can’t shameproof our children. Our task instead is teaching and\\nmodeling shame resilience, and that starts with conversations about what shame\\nis and how it shows up in our lives. The adults I interviewed who were raised by\\nparents who used shame as a primary parenting tool had much more difficulty\\nbelieving in their worthiness than the participants who experienced shame\\noccasionally and were able to talk about it with their parents.\\nIf you have grown children and are wondering if it’s too late to teach shame\\nresilience or to change the album, the answer is no. It’s not too late. The power\\nof owning our stories, even the difficult ones, is that we get to write the ending.\\nSeveral years ago, I received a letter from a woman who wrote:\\nYour work changed my life in a very strange way. My mom saw you speak at a church in Amarillo. Afterwards, she wrote\\nme a long letter that said, “I had no idea there was a difference between shame and guilt. I think I shamed you your entire life.\\nI meant to use guilt. I never thought you weren’t good enough. I did not like your choices. But I shamed you. I can’t take that\\nback, but I need you to know that you’re the best thing that ever happened to me and I’m so proud to be your mother.” I\\ncouldn’t believe it. My mom is seventy-five and I’m fifty-five. It healed so much. And it changed everything, including the\\nway I parent my own kids.\\nIn addition to helping our children understand shame, and use guilt self-talk\\nrather than shame self-talk, we have to be very careful about shame leakage.\\nEven if we don’t shame our children, shame still shows up in our lives in ways\\nthat can have a powerful affect on our family. Basically, we can’t raise children\\nwho are more shame resilient than we are. I can encourage Ellen to love her\\nbody, but what really matters are the observations she makes about my\\nrelationship with my own body. Damn it. I can soothe Charlie’s concerns that he\\nmight run the wrong direction around the bases by telling him that he doesn’t\\nhave to fully understand the ins and outs of baseball before his first T-ball game,\\nbut does he observe me and Steve trying new things, making mistakes, and\\nfailing without becoming self-critical? Damn it. Again.\\nLastly, normalizing is one of the most powerful shame-resilience tools that we\\ncan offer our children. Like I explained in the last chapter, normalizing means\\nhelping our children know they’re not alone and that we’ve experienced many of\\nthe same struggles. This applies to social situations, changes in their bodies,\\nshaming experiences, feeling left out, and wanting to be brave but feeling afraid.\\nThere’s something sacred that happens between a parent and a child when the\\nparent says, “Me too!” or shares a personal story that relates to their child’s\\nstruggle.\\nMINDING \\nTHE \\nGAP: \\nSUPPORTING \\nOUR\\nCHILDREN MEANS SUPPORTING EACH OTHER\\nI believe it’s important at this point to pause to recognize the shaming nature of\\nparenting “values” debates. When you listen to conversations, or read books and\\nblogs, about controversial and/or divisive issues in parenting, like how and\\nwhere women labor, circumcision, vaccinations, co-sleeping, feeding, etc., what\\nyou hear is shame and what you see is hurt. Deep hurt. You see people—mostly\\nmothers—engaging in the exact same behaviors that I earlier defined as\\nshaming: name calling, put-downs, and bullying.\\nHere’s what I’ve come to believe about these behaviors: You can’t claim to\\ncare about the welfare of children if you’re shaming other parents for the\\nchoices they’re making. Those are mutually exclusive behaviors and they create\\na huge values gap. Yes, most of us (myself included) have strong opinions on\\nevery one of those topics, but if we really care about the broader welfare of\\nchildren, our job is to make choices that are aligned with our values and support\\nother parents who are doing the same. Our job is also to tend to our own\\nworthiness. When we feel good about the choices we’re making and when we’re\\nengaging with the world from a place of worthiness rather than scarcity, we feel\\nno need to judge and attack.\\nIt’s easy to put up a straw man in this argument and say, “So we’re just\\nsupposed to ignore parents who are abusing their children?” Fact: That someone\\nis making different choices from us doesn’t in itself constitute abuse. If there’s\\nreal abuse happening, by all means, call the police. If not, we shouldn’t call it\\nabuse. As a social worker who spent a year interning at Child Protective\\nServices, I have little tolerance for debates that casually use the terms abuse or\\nneglect to scare or belittle parents who are simply doing things that we judge as\\nwrong, different, or bad.\\nIn fact, I’ve sworn off the good-bad parenting dichotomy simply because on\\nany given day you could file me under both good parent and bad parent,\\ndepending on your perspective and how things are going for me. I just don’t see\\nwhat value this judgmental frame adds to our lives or to the larger parenting\\nconversation. In fact, it’s a shame storm waiting to happen. To me the question\\nof parenting values is about engagement. Are we paying attention? Thinking\\nthrough our choices? Open to learning and being wrong? Curious and willing to\\nask questions?\\nWhat I’ve learned from my work is that there are a million ways out in the\\nworld to be a wonderful, engaged parent, and some of them are going to bump\\nup against what I personally think about parenting. For example, Steve and I are\\nvery strict about what we let the kids watch on TV—especially when it comes to\\nviolence. We think about it, talk about it, and make the best decisions we can. On\\nthe other hand, we’ve got friends who let their children watch movies and shows\\nthat we don’t allow Ellen or Charlie watch. But you know what? They also think\\nabout it, talk about it, and make the best decisions they can. They just came to a\\ndifferent conclusion than we did, and I respect that.\\nWe recently found ourselves on the other side of this issue when some good\\nfriends expressed surprise that we let Ellen read The Hunger Games. Again,\\nthose parents were also engaged in the question, and the conversation we had\\nshowed mutual respect and empathy. Minding the gap can be particularly\\nchallenging when honoring difference is one of our aspirational values. I think\\nthe key is remembering that when other parents make different choices than\\nwe’re making, it’s not necessarily criticism. Daring greatly means finding our\\nown path and respecting what that search looks like for other folks.\\nMINDING THE GAP AND BELONGING\\nWorthiness is about love and belonging, and one of the best ways to show our\\nchildren that our love for them is unconditional is to make sure they know they\\nbelong in our families. I know that sounds strange, but it’s a very powerful and\\nat times heart-wrenching issue for children. On page 145, I defined belonging as\\nthe innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. One of the\\nbiggest surprises in this research was learning that fitting in and belonging are\\nnot the same thing. In fact, fitting in is one of the greatest barriers to belonging.\\nFitting in is about assessing a situation and becoming who you need to be in\\norder to be accepted. Belonging, on the other hand, doesn’t require us to change\\nwho we are; it requires us to be who we are.\\nWhen I asked a large group of eighth graders to break into small teams and\\ncome up with the differences between fitting in and belonging, their answers\\nfloored me:\\nBelonging is being somewhere where you want to be, and they want you.\\nFitting in is being somewhere where you really want to be, but they don’t\\ncare one way or the other.\\nBelonging is being accepted for you. Fitting in is being accepted for being\\nlike everyone else.\\nI get to be me if I belong. I have to be like you to fit in.\\nThey nailed the definitions. It doesn’t matter where in the country I ask this\\nquestion, or what type of school I’m visiting, middle and high school students\\nunderstand how this works.\\nThey also talk openly about the heartache of not feeling a sense of belonging\\nat home. That first time I asked the eighth graders to come up with the\\ndefinitions, one student wrote, “Not belonging at school is really hard. But it’s\\nnothing compared to what it feels like when you don’t belong at home.” When I\\nasked the students what that meant, they used these examples:\\nNot living up to your parents’ expectations\\nNot being as cool or popular as your parents want you to be\\nNot being as smart as your parents\\nNot being good at the same things your parents were good at\\nYour parents being embarrassed because you don’t have enough friends or\\nyou’re not an athlete or a cheerleader\\nYour parents not liking who you are and what you like to do\\nWhen your parents don’t pay attention to your life\\nIf we want to cultivate worthiness in our children, we need to make sure they\\nknow that they belong and that their belonging is unconditional. What makes\\nthat such a challenge is that most of us struggle to feel a sense of belonging—to\\nknow that we’re a part of something, not despite our vulnerabilities, but because\\nof them. We can’t give our children what we don’t have, which means we have\\nto work to cultivate a sense of belonging alongside our children. Here’s an\\nexample of how we can grow together and how our children are capable of great\\nempathy. (There’s nothing that inspires that deep sense of belonging like shared\\nempathy!)\\nWhen Ellen was in fourth grade, she came home from school one day and\\nburst into tears as soon as we shut the front door, then ran up to her room. I\\nimmediately followed, then knelt down in front of her and asked her what was\\nwrong. Through her sniffles she said, “I’m so tired of being the other! I’m sick\\nof it!”\\nI didn’t understand, so I asked her to explain what she meant by “the other.”\\n“We play soccer every day at recess. Two popular kids are the captains and\\nthey pick the teams. The first captain says, ‘I’ll take Suzie, John, Pete, Robin,\\nand Jake.’ The second captain says, ‘I’ll take Andrew, Steve, Katie, and Sue, and\\nwe can split the others.’ Every single day I’m one of the others. I never get to be\\nnamed.”\\nMy heart sank. She was sitting on the edge of her bed with her head in her\\nhands. I was so concerned when I followed her into her room that I hadn’t even\\nflipped on the light. I couldn’t stand the vulnerability of seeing her sitting in the\\ndark crying, so I walked over to the light switch. It was divine intervention—the\\nact of starting to turn on the lights to alleviate my discomfort made me think of\\nmy favorite quote about darkness and compassion from Pema Chödrön, who\\nwrites: “Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.\\nIt’s a relationship between equals. Only when we know our own darkness well\\ncan we be present with the darkness of others. Compassion becomes real when\\nwe recognize our shared humanity.”\\nI left the light switch alone and walked back to sit with Ellen in the literal and\\nemotional dark. I put my arm around her shoulder and said, “I know what it’s\\nlike to be the other.”\\nShe wiped her nose on the back of her hand and said, “No, you don’t. You’re\\nreally popular.”\\nI explained that I really do know what it feels like. I told her, “When I feel like\\nthe other, I get angry and hurt, and I mostly feel small and lonely. I don’t need to\\nbe popular, but I want people to recognize me and treat me like I matter. Like I\\nbelong.”\\nShe couldn’t believe it. “You do know! That’s exactly how I feel!”\\nWe snuggled on her bed, and she told me about her recess experiences, and I\\ntold her about some of my experiences in school when otherness is both\\npowerful and painful.\\nAbout two weeks later, we were both at home when the mail arrived. I ran to\\nthe door with great anticipation. I was scheduled to speak at a star-studded event,\\nand I was dying to see the publicity poster. It seems weird now, but I was so\\nexcited at the idea of seeing my photo next to the pictures of the movie stars. I\\nsat down on the couch with the poster, I unrolled it, and I started scanning like a\\nmadwoman. Just as I was doing this, Ellen walked in and said, “Cool! Is that\\nyour poster? Let me see!”\\nAs she walked over to the couch, she could tell my mood had changed from\\nanticipation to disappointment. “What’s wrong, Mom?”\\nI patted the couch and she sat down next to me. I held the poster open, and she\\ntraced the pictures with her finger. “I don’t see you. Where are you?”\\nI pointed to a line on the poster under the celebrity photos that said, “And\\nothers.”\\nEllen leaned back against the sofa cushions, put her head on my shoulder, and\\nsaid, “Oh, Mom, I think you’re the others. I’m sorry.”\\nI didn’t reply right away. I was feeling small both because there was no\\npicture and for caring that there was no picture. Ellen leaned forward, looked at\\nme, and said, “I know what that feels like. When I’m the other, I feel hurt and\\nsmall and lonely. We all want to matter and belong.”\\nIt turned out to be one of the best moments of my life. We may not always\\nhave a sense of belonging on the recess playground or at a big, fancy conference,\\nbut in that moment we knew that we belonged where it mattered the most—at\\nhome. Parenting perfection is not the goal. In fact, the best gifts—the best\\nteaching moments—happen in those imperfect moments when we allow children\\nto help us mind the gap.\\nHere’s a powerful story about cultivating shame resilience and minding the\\ngap from Susan, a woman I interviewed a couple of years ago. Susan was busy\\ntalking to a group of mothers at her kids’ school while her kids were standing\\nclose by waiting for her to take them home. The mothers were discussing who\\nwould host the “Welcome Kinder Kids” party for the new students. They all\\nhated the thought of doing it, but the one woman who volunteered to throw the\\nparty had “a filthy house.” After talking about this woman and her house for a\\nfew minutes, they agreed that letting her host the party would reflect poorly on\\nthem and the PTO.\\nWhen they finished their discussion, Susan loaded up the kids (a daughter in\\nkinder, and two sons—one in first grade and another in third grade) and started\\nhome. Susan’s first-grade son randomly called out from the backseat, “I think\\nyou’re a great mom.” Susan smiled and said, “Well, thank you.” A few minutes\\nafter they walked in the house, the same child came up to her with big tears in\\nhis eyes. He looked at Susan and said, “Do you feel bad about yourself? Are you\\nokay?”\\nSusan said she was completely taken by surprise. She knelt down and said,\\n“No. Why? What’s wrong?”\\nHer son replied, “You always say that when people get together and talk bad\\nabout someone just because they are different, it means they might feel bad\\nabout themselves. You said that when we feel good about who we are, we don’t\\nsay mean things about other people.”\\nSusan immediately recognized the warm wash of shame. She knew that her\\nson had overheard the conversation at the school.\\nThis is the moment. The Wholehearted parenting moment. Can we tolerate the\\nvulnerability long enough to be with it for a minute? Or do we need to discharge\\nthe shame and discomfort by redirecting our child or blaming them for “crossing\\na line?” Can we take this opportunity to acknowledge how wonderfully he’s\\npracticing empathy? Can we make mistakes and make amends? If we want our\\nkids to own and be honest about their experiences, can we own ours?\\nSusan looked at her son and said, “Thank you so much for checking on me\\nand asking me how I feel. I feel okay, but I think I made a mistake. I need a little\\ntime to think about all of this. You’re right about one thing—I was saying hurtful\\nthings.”\\nAfter Susan pulled herself together, she sat down with her son and they talked.\\nThey discussed how easy it is to get caught up in a group situation where\\neveryone is talking about someone. Susan was honest and admitted that she\\nsometimes struggles with “what people think.” She said her son leaned into her\\nand whispered, “Me too.” They promised to keep talking to each other about\\ntheir experiences.\\nEngagement means investing time and energy. It means sitting down with our\\nchildren and understanding their worlds, their interests, and their stories.\\nEngaged parents can be found on both sides of all of the controversial parenting\\ndebates. They come from different values, traditions, and cultures. What they\\nshare in common is practicing the values. What they seem to share is a\\nphilosophy of “I’m not perfect and I’m not always right, but I’m here, open,\\npaying attention, loving you, and fully engaged.”\\nThere is no question that engagement requires sacrifice, but that’s what we\\nsigned up for when we decided to become parents. Most of us have so many\\ncompeting demands on our time that it’s easy to think, I can’t sacrifice three\\nhours to sit down and review my son’s Facebook page or sit with my daughter\\nwhile she explains every detail of the fourth grade science fair scandal. I\\nstruggle with that too. But Jimmy Grace, a priest from our Episcopal church,\\nrecently gave a sermon about the nature of sacrifice and it totally shifted how I\\nthink about parenting. He explained that in its original Latin form, sacrifice\\nmeans to make sacred or to make holy. I Wholeheartedly believe that when we\\nare fully engaged in parenting, regardless of how imperfect, vulnerable, and\\nmessy it is, we are creating something sacred.\\nTHE COURAGE TO BE VULNERABLE\\nBefore writing this section, I spread my data all over my dining room table and\\nasked myself this question: What do parents experience as the most vulnerable\\nand bravest thing that they do in their efforts to raise Wholehearted children? I\\nthought it would take days to figure it out, but as I looked over the field notes,\\nthe answer was obvious: letting their children struggle and experience adversity.\\nAs I travel across the country there seems to be growing concern on the part\\nof parents and teachers that children are not learning how to handle adversity or\\ndisappointment because we’re always rescuing and protecting them. What’s\\ninteresting is that more often than not, I hear this concern from the same parents\\nwho are chronically intervening, rescuing, and protecting. It’s not that our\\nchildren can’t stand the vulnerability of handling their own situations, it’s that\\nwe can’t stand the uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure, even when we\\nknow it’s the right thing to do.\\nI used to struggle with letting go and allowing my children to find their own\\nway, but something that I learned in the research dramatically changed my\\nperspective and I no longer see rescuing and intervening as unhelpful, I now\\nthink about it as dangerous. Don’t get me wrong—I still struggle and I still step\\nin when I shouldn’t, but I now think twice before I let my discomfort dictate my\\nbehaviors. Here’s why: Hope is a function of struggle. If we want our children\\nto develop high levels of hopefulness, we have to let them struggle. And let me\\ntell you, next to love and belonging, I’m not sure I want anything more for my\\nkids than a deep sense of hopefulness.\\nExperience with adversity, tenacity, and grit emerged in my research as an\\nimportant quality of Wholeheartedness. I was so grateful to see it because it was\\none of the few qualities of Wholeheartedness that I had at the time (remember in\\nthe introduction—I was two for ten). When I went into the literature to search\\nfor a concept that had all of these elements, I found C. R. Snyder’s research on\\nhope. I was shocked. First, I thought hope was a warm, fuzzy emotion—the\\nfeeling of possibility. Second, I was looking for something that I had thought of\\nas being scrappy and nicknamed “Plan B”—these folks could turn to Plan B\\nwhen Plan A fell apart.\\nAs it turns out, I was wrong about hope and right about scrappy and Plan B.\\nAccording to Snyder, who dedicated his career to studying this topic, hope isn’t\\nan emotion; it’s a way of thinking or a cognitive process. Emotions play a\\nsupporting role, but hope is really a thought process made up of what Snyder\\ncalls a trilogy of goals, pathways, and agency. In very simple terms, hope\\nhappens when:\\nWe have the ability to set realistic goals (I know where I want to go).\\nWe are able to figure out how to achieve those goals, including the ability to\\nstay flexible and develop alternative routes (I know how to get there, I’m\\npersistent, and I can tolerate disappointment and try again).\\nWe believe in ourselves (I can do this!).\\nSo, hope is a combination of setting goals, having the tenacity and\\nperseverance to pursue them, and believing in our own abilities. Hope is Plan B.\\nAnd, here’s the part that inspired me to deal with my own vulnerability so I\\ncould step back and let my children learn how to figure some things out on their\\nown: Hope is learned! According to Snyder, children most often learn hope from\\ntheir parents. To learn hopefulness, children need relationships that are\\ncharacterized by boundaries, consistency, and support. Children with high levels\\nof hopefulness have experience with adversity. They’ve been given the\\nopportunity to struggle and in doing that they learn how to believe in themselves.\\nRaising children who are hopeful and who have the courage to be vulnerable\\nmeans stepping back and letting them experience disappointment, deal with\\nconflict, learn how to assert themselves, and have the opportunity to fail. If\\nwe’re always following our children into the arena, hushing the critics, and\\nassuring their victory, they’ll never learn that they have the ability to dare\\ngreatly on their own.\\nOne of my best lessons on this comes from an experience that I had with\\nEllen. It began when I was still ten cars away from her in the swim team pickup\\nline. It was getting dark, so I could only make out her silhouette, but that was\\nenough: I could tell something was wrong by the way she was standing. She\\nflung herself into the front seat, and before I could ask her about practice, she\\nwas in tears.\\n“What happened? What’s wrong? Are you okay?”\\nShe stared out the window, drew a deep breath as she wiped her tears on the\\nsleeve of her hoodie, and said, “I have to swim the 100 breaststroke at the meet\\non Saturday.”\\nI knew this was a really bad thing in her world, so I tried not to seem relieved\\n—which I was because, in a crazy-but-normal-for-me fashion, I was already\\nthinking something really horrible had happened.\\n“You don’t understand. I can’t swim breaststroke. I’m terrible. You don’t get\\nit. I begged him not to put me in that event.”\\nI was getting ready to respond with something empathetic and encouraging as\\nI pulled into the driveway, but just then she looked me right in the eyes, put her\\nhand on top of my hand, and said, “Please, Mom. Please help me. I’m still going\\nto be swimming when the other girls are getting out of the pool and the next heat\\nis getting on the blocks. I’m really that slow.”\\nI couldn’t swallow. I couldn’t think clearly. All of a sudden, I’m ten years old\\nand I’m on the blocks getting ready to swim for the Memorial Northwest\\nMarlins. My dad is the starter, and he’s giving me the win-or-die look. I’m in the\\nlane closest to the wall—the slow lane. It’s going to be a disaster. Moments\\nearlier, as I was sitting on the ready bench contemplating making a run for my\\nbanana-seat bike leaning against the fence by the diving boards, I overheard the\\ncoach say, “Let’s just swim her up an age group. I’m not sure she can finish the\\nrace, but it will be interesting.”\\n“Mom? Mom?? Mom!!! Are you listening to me? Will you help me? Will you\\ntalk to the coach and see if he’ll put me in another race?”\\nThe vulnerability felt unbearable and I wanted to scream, “Yes! You don’t\\nhave to swim any event that you don’t want to swim. EVER!” But I didn’t. Calm\\nwas one of my new Wholehearted practices, so I took a deep breath, counted to\\nfive, and said, “Let me talk to your dad.”\\nAfter the kids went to bed, Steve and I spent an hour debating the issue and\\nfinally agreed that she would have to take it up with her coach. If he wanted her\\nto swim that race, she needed to swim it. As right as the decision felt, I hated\\nevery minute of it, and I tried everything from picking a fight with Steve to\\nblaming the coach to venting my fear and discharging the vulnerability.\\nEllen was upset when we told her this, and even more upset when she came\\nhome from practice and told us that her coach thought it was important for her to\\nget an official time for the event. She folded her arms on the table, put her head\\ndown, and cried. At one point she lifted up her head and said, “I could just\\nscratch the event. A lot of people miss their heats.” A part of me thought,\\nPerfect! But then she said, “I won’t win. I’m not even good enough to get second\\nor third place. Everyone is going to be watching.”\\nThis was the opportunity to move the levers—to redefine what’s important to\\nher. To make our family culture more influential than the swim meet, her friends,\\nand the ultracompetitive sports culture that is rampant in our community. I\\nlooked at her and said, “You can scratch that event. I’d probably consider that\\noption too. But what if your goal for that race isn’t to win or even to get out of\\nthe water at the same time as the other girls? What if your goal is to show up and\\nget wet?”\\nShe looked at me as if I was crazy. “Just show up and get in the water?”\\nI explained that I had spent many years never trying anything that I wasn’t\\nalready good at doing, and how those choices almost made me forget what it\\nfeels like to be brave. I said, “Sometimes the bravest and most important thing\\nyou can do is just show up.”\\nSteve and I made sure that we weren’t with her when her heat was called.\\nWhen it was time for the girls to get on the blocks, I wasn’t sure if she’d be\\nthere, but she was. We stood at the end of her lane and held our breath. She\\nlooked right at us, nodded her head, and snapped her goggles into place.\\nShe was the last one out of the pool. The other swimmers had already left the\\ndeck, and there were girls standing on the blocks ready for the next heat. Steve\\nand I screamed and cheered the entire time. When she got out of the pool, she\\nwalked over to her coach, who gave her a hug, then showed her something about\\nher kick. When she finally made her way to us, she was smiling and a little\\ntearful. She looked at her dad and me and said, “That was pretty bad, but I did it.\\nI showed up and I got wet. I was brave.”\\nI wrote the following parenting manifesto because I need it. Steve and I need\\nit. Putting down the measuring stick in a culture that uses acquisitions and\\naccomplishments to assess worth is not easy. I use the manifesto as a touchstone,\\na prayer, and a meditation when I’m wrestling with vulnerability or when I’ve\\ngot that “never enough” fear. It reminds me of the finding that changed and\\nprobably saved my life: Who we are and how we engage with the world are\\nmuch stronger predictors of how our children will do than what we know about\\nparenting.\\nThe Wholehearted Parenting Manifesto\\nAbove all else, I want you to know that you are loved and lovable.\\nYou will learn this from my words and actions—the lessons on love are in how I treat you and how I treat myself.\\nI want you to engage with the world from a place of worthiness.\\nYou will learn that you are worthy of love, belonging, and joy every time you see me practice self-compassion and\\nembrace my own imperfections.\\nWe will practice courage in our family by showing up, letting ourselves be seen, and honoring vulnerability. We will share\\nour stories of struggle and strength. There will always be room in our home for both.\\nWe will teach you compassion by practicing compassion with ourselves first; then with each other. We will set and respect\\nboundaries; we will honor hard work, hope, and perseverance. Rest and play will be family values, as well as family practices.\\nYou will learn accountability and respect by watching me make mistakes and make amends, and by watching how I ask\\nfor what I need and talk about how I feel.\\nI want you to know joy, so together we will practice gratitude.\\nI want you to feel joy, so together we will learn how to be vulnerable.\\nWhen uncertainty and scarcity visit, you will be able to draw from the spirit that is a part of our everyday life.\\nTogether we will cry and face fear and grief. I will want to take away your pain, but instead I will sit with you and teach\\nyou how to feel it.\\nWe will laugh and sing and dance and create. We will always have permission to be ourselves with each other. No matter\\nwhat, you will always belong here.\\nAs you begin your Wholehearted journey, the greatest gift that I can give to you is to live and love with my whole heart\\nand to dare greatly.\\nI will not teach or love or show you anything perfectly, but I will let you see me, and I will always hold sacred the gift of\\nseeing you. Truly, deeply, seeing you.\\nYou can download a copy of this manifesto from my website (www.brenebrown.com).\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have\\ndone them better.\\nThe credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives\\nvaliantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,\\nbecause there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great\\nenthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;\\nwho at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring\\ngreatly.…\\n—Theodore Roosevelt\\nIn the nine months that it took me to shape and prune a dozen years of\\nresearch into this book, I’ve revisited this quote at least one hundred times. And\\ntruthfully, I normally come back to it in fits of rage or with tearstained\\ndesperation, thinking, Maybe this is all bullshit, or It’s not worth the\\nvulnerability. Just recently, after enduring a few really mean-spirited anonymous\\ncomments from a news website, I pulled the quote down from the pinboard over\\nmy desk and spoke directly to the sheet of paper, “If the critic doesn’t count,\\nthen why does this hurt so much?”\\nThe paper didn’t respond.\\nAs I held the quote in my hand, I remembered a conversation that I had just\\nhad with a guy in his very early twenties. He told me that his parents sent him\\nlinks to my TED talks and he really liked the idea of Wholeheartedness and\\ndaring greatly. When he told me that the talks inspired him to tell the young\\nwoman he’s been dating for several months that he loved her, I winced and\\nhoped for a happy ending to the story.\\nNo such luck. She told him that she thought he was “awesome” but that she\\nthought they should date other people. When he got back to his apartment after\\ntalking to his girlfriend, he told his two roommates what had happened. He said,\\n“They were both hunched over their laptops and without looking up one of them\\nwas like ‘What were you thinking, man?’” One of his roommates told him that\\ngirls only like guys who are running the other way. He looked at me and said, “I\\nfelt pretty stupid at first. For a second I was mad at myself and even a little\\npissed at you. But then I thought about it and I remembered why I did it. I told\\nmy roommates, ‘I was daring greatly, dude.’”\\nHe smiled when he told me, “They stopped typing, looked at me, nodded their\\nheads, and said, ‘Oh. Right on, dude.’”\\nDaring greatly is not about winning or losing. It’s about courage. In a world\\nwhere scarcity and shame dominate and feeling afraid has become second\\nnature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. It’s even a little dangerous at\\ntimes. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means there’s a far\\ngreater risk of feeling hurt. But as I look back on my own life and what Daring\\nGreatly has meant to me, I can honestly say that nothing is as uncomfortable,\\ndangerous, and hurtful as believing that I’m standing on the outside of my life\\nlooking in and wondering what it would be like if I had the courage to show up\\nand let myself be seen.\\nSo, Mr. Roosevelt…I think you nailed it. There really is “no effort without\\nerror and shortcoming” and there really is no triumph without vulnerability. Now\\nwhen I read that quote, even when I’m feeling kicked around, all I can think is,\\nRight on, dude.\\nAPPENDIX\\nTrust in Emergence:\\nGrounded Theory and My Research Process\\nCaminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar.\\nTraveler, there is no path, the path must be forged as you walk.\\nThis line from the Spanish poet Antonio Machado captures the spirit of my\\nresearch process and the theories that emerged from that process. Initially I set\\nout, on what I thought was a well-traveled path, to find empirical evidence of\\nwhat I knew to be true. I soon realized that conducting research centering on\\nwhat matters to research participants—grounded theory research—means there\\nis no path and, certainly, there is no way of knowing what you will find.\\nThe most difficult challenges of becoming a grounded theory researcher are:\\n1. Acknowledging that it is virtually impossible to understand grounded\\ntheory methodology prior to using it,\\n2. Developing the courage to let the research participants define the research\\nproblem, and\\n3. Letting go of your own interests and preconceived ideas to “trust in\\nemergence.”\\nIronically (or maybe not), these are also the challenges of Daring Greatly and\\nliving a courageous life.\\nBelow is an overview of the design, methodology, sampling, and coding\\nprocesses that I use in my research. Before we jump in, I want to acknowledge\\nBarney Glaser and Anselm Strauss for their pioneering work in qualitative\\nresearch and for developing grounded theory methodology. And, to Dr. Glaser,\\nwho was willing to commute from California to serve as the methodologist on\\nmy dissertation committee at the University of Houston: You literally changed\\nthe way I see the world.\\nTHE RESEARCH JOURNEY\\nAs a doctoral student, the power of statistics and the clean lines of quantitative\\nresearch appealed to me, but I fell in love with the richness and depth of\\nqualitative research. Storytelling is my DNA, and I couldn’t resist the idea of\\nresearch as story-catching. Stories are data with a soul and no methodology\\nhonors that more than grounded theory. The mandate of grounded theory is to\\ndevelop theories based on people’s lived experiences rather than proving or\\ndisproving existing theories.\\nBehavioral researcher Fred Kerlinger defines theory as “a set of interrelated\\nconstructs or concepts, definitions, and propositions that present a systematic\\nview of phenomena specifying relations among variables, with the purpose of\\nexplaining and predicting the phenomena.” In grounded theory we don’t start\\nwith a problem or a hypothesis or a literature review, we start with a topic. We\\nlet the participants define the problem or their main concern about the topic, we\\ndevelop a theory, and then we see how and where it fits in the literature.\\nI didn’t sign on to study shame—one of the most (if not the most) complex\\nand multifaceted emotions that we experience. A topic that not only took me six\\nyears to understand, but an emotion that is so powerful that the mere mention of\\nthe word shame triggers discomfort and avoidance in people. I innocently started\\nwith an interest in learning more about the anatomy of connection.\\nAfter fifteen years of social work education, I was sure of one thing:\\nConnection is why we’re here; it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.\\nThe power that connection holds in our lives was confirmed when the main\\nconcern about connection emerged as the fear of disconnection; the fear that\\nsomething we’ve done or failed to do, something about who we are or where we\\ncome from, has made us unlovable and unworthy of connection. I learned that\\nwe resolve this concern by understanding our vulnerabilities and cultivating\\nempathy, courage, and compassion—what I call shame resilience.\\nAfter developing a theory on shame resilience, and getting clear about the\\neffect of scarcity on our lives, I wanted to dig deeper—I wanted to know more.\\nThe problem is that there’s only so much you can understand about shame and\\nscarcity by asking about shame and scarcity. I needed another approach to get\\nunder the experiences. That’s when I had the idea to borrow a few principles\\nfrom chemistry.\\nIn chemistry, especially thermodynamics, if you have an element or property\\nthat is too volatile to measure, you often have to rely on indirect measurement.\\nYou measure the property by combining and reducing related, less volatile\\ncompounds until those relationships and manipulations reveal a measurement of\\nyour original property. My idea was to learn more about shame and scarcity by\\nexploring what exists in their absence.\\nI know how people experience and move through shame, but what are people\\nfeeling, doing, and thinking when shame doesn’t constantly have a knife to their\\nthroats, threatening them with being unworthy of connection? How are some\\npeople living right alongside us in this culture of scarcity and still holding on to\\nthe belief that they are enough? I knew these people existed because I had\\ninterviewed them and used some of the incidents from their data to inform my\\nwork on empathy and shame resilience.\\nBefore I dove back into the data, I named this study “Wholehearted Living.” I\\nwas looking for women and men living and loving with their whole hearts\\ndespite the risks and uncertainty. I wanted to know what they had in common.\\nWhat were their main concerns, and what were the patterns and themes that\\ndefined their Wholeheartedness? I reported the findings from that study in The\\nGifts of Imperfection and an academic journal article that will be published in\\nlate 2012 or early 2013.\\nVulnerability has consistently emerged as a core category in my work. It was a\\ncritical component in both my study on shame and my study on\\nWholeheartedness, and there’s even a chapter on it in my dissertation on\\nconnection. I understood the relationships between vulnerability and the other\\nemotions that I’ve studied, but after years of dropping deeper and deeper into\\nthis work, I wanted to know more about vulnerability and how it worked. The\\ngrounded theory that emerged from this investigation is the subject of this book\\nand another academic article in press.\\nDESIGN\\nAs I’ve mentioned, grounded theory methodology, as originally developed by\\nGlaser and Strauss and refined by Glaser informed the plan of research for my\\nstudies. The grounded theory process consists of five basic components:\\ntheoretical sensitivity, theoretical sampling, coding, theoretical memoing, and\\nsorting. These five components were integrated by the constant-comparison\\nmethod of data analysis. The goal of the research was to understand the\\nparticipants’ “main concerns” related to experiencing the topic being examined\\n(e.g., shame, Wholeheartedness, vulnerability). Once the main concerns emerged\\nfrom the data, I developed a theory that explains how the participants continually\\nresolve their concerns in their daily lives.\\nSAMPLE\\nTheoretical sampling, the process of data collection that allows for the\\ngeneration of theory, was the primary sampling method that I used in this study.\\nWhen using theoretical sampling, the researcher simultaneously collects, codes,\\nand analyzes data and uses this ongoing process to determine what data to\\ncollect next and where to find them. In line with theoretical sampling, I selected\\nparticipants based on the analysis and coding interviews and secondary data.\\nOne important tenet of grounded theory is the idea that researchers should not\\nassume the relevance of identity data, including race, age, gender, sexual\\norientation, class, and ability. Although the relevance of these variables was not\\nassumed, purposive sampling (intentionally sampling across identity data) was\\nused with theoretical sampling to ensure that a diverse group of participants were\\ninterviewed. At certain points during my research, identity data indeed emerged\\nas relevant, and in these cases purposive sampling continued to inform the\\ntheoretical sample. In categories where identity did not emerge as relevant,\\ntheoretical sampling was used exclusively.\\nI interviewed 750 female participants, approximately 43 percent of whom\\nidentified themselves as Caucasian, 30 percent as African-American, 18 percent\\nas Latina, and 9 percent as Asian-American. The female participants’ ages\\nranged from eighteen to eighty-eight years, with a mean of forty-one. I\\ninterviewed 530 men, approximately 40 percent of whom identified themselves\\nas Caucasian, 25 percent as African-American, 20 percent as Latino, and 15\\npercent identified as Asian. The mean age of the men interviewed was forty-six\\n(the range was eighteen to eighty).\\nAlthough grounded-theory methodology often yields theoretical saturation\\n(the point at which no new conceptual insights are generated and the researcher\\nhas provided repeated evidence for his or her conceptual categories) with far\\nfewer than my total 1,280 participants, three interrelated theories emerged with\\nmultiple core categories and numerous properties informing each category. The\\nnuanced and complex nature of shame resilience, Wholeheartedness, and\\nvulnerability necessitated the large sample size.\\nA basic tenet of grounded theory is “all is data.” Glaser writes, “The briefest\\ncomment to the lengthiest interview, written words in magazines, books and\\nnewspapers, documents, observations, biases of self and others, spurious\\nvariables, or whatever else may come the researcher’s way in his substantive\\narea of research is data for grounded theory.”\\nIn addition to the 1,280 participant interviews, I analyzed field notes that I had\\ntaken on sensitizing literature, conversations with content experts, and field\\nnotes from my meetings with graduate students who conducted participant\\ninterviews and assisted with the literature analysis. Additionally, I recorded and\\ncoded field notes on the experience of taking approximately 400 master and\\ndoctoral social-worker students through my graduate course on shame,\\nvulnerability, and empathy, and training an estimated 15,000 mental health and\\naddiction professionals.\\nI also coded over 3,500 pieces of secondary data. These include clinical case\\nstudies and case notes, letters, and journal pages. In total, I coded approximately\\n11,000 incidents (phrases and sentences from the original field notes) using the\\nconstant comparative method (line-by-line analysis). I did all of this coding\\nmanually, as software is not recommended in Glaserian-grounded theory.\\nI collected all of the data with the exception of 215 participant interviews that\\nwere conducted by graduate social-work students working under my direction.\\nIn order to ensure inter-rater reliability, I trained all research assistants and I\\ncoded and analyzed all of their field notes.\\nApproximately half of the interviews were individual meetings and the other\\nhalf happened in dyads, triads, and groups. Interview times ranged from forty-\\nfive minutes to three hours, with an average of approximately sixty minutes.\\nAdjusted conversational interviewing was utilized because it is regarded as the\\nmost effective grounded theory approach to interviewing.\\nCODING\\nI used the constant comparative method to analyze the data line by line, and then\\nI developed memos to capture the emergent concepts and their relationships. The\\nprimary focus of the analysis was identifying the participants’ main concerns and\\nthe emergence of a core variable. As I conducted additional interviews, I\\nreconceptualized categories and identified the properties that inform each\\ncategory. I used selective coding when core concepts emerged and the data were\\nsaturated across categories and across their properties.\\nGrounded theory researchers are required to conceptualize from the data. This\\napproach is very different from traditional qualitative methods that yield findings\\nbased on thick description of data and participant quotes. To conceptualize\\nshame, Wholeheartedness, and vulnerability, and to identify the participants’\\nmain concerns about these topics, I analyzed data line by line while asking the\\nfollowing questions: What are the participants describing? What do they care\\nabout? What are they worried about? What are the participants trying to do?\\nWhat explains the different behaviors, thoughts, and actions? Again, I used the\\nconstant comparative method to reexamine the data against the emerging\\ncategories and their related properties.\\nLITERATURE ANALYSIS\\nFor the same reasons the grounded theorist allows the research problem to\\nemerge from the data, a full review of the significant literature is conducted after\\nthe theory is generated from the data. The literature reviews done in quantitative\\nresearch and traditional qualitative research serve as buttresses on both sides of\\nresearch findings—literature reviews are conducted to support the need for new\\nresearch, the research is conducted, findings emerge independent of the\\nliterature, and the research is again supported by the literature to demonstrate its\\ncontribution to the researcher’s profession.\\nIn grounded theory, data buttress the theory and the literature is part of the\\ndata. I learned very quickly that grounded-theory researchers cannot go into the\\nliterature review thinking, The theory has emerged, I’m done, how does it fit?\\nInstead, the grounded theorist must understand that the literature review is\\nactually a literature analysis and it is not separate from the research but is a\\ncontinuation of the process.\\nThe references and related research quoted in this book both supported and\\ninformed the emerging theories.\\nEVALUATING GROUNDED THEORY\\nAccording to Glaser, grounded theories are evaluated by assessing their fit,\\nrelevance, workability, and modifiability. The theory has achieved “fit” when the\\ncategories of the theory fit the data. Violations of fit occur when data are forced\\ninto preformed categories or discarded in favor of keeping an existing theory\\nintact.\\nIn addition to fit, the theory must be relevant to the action of the area.\\nGrounded theories are relevant when they allow the core problems and processes\\nto emerge. Workability is achieved if the theory can explain what happened,\\npredict what will happen, and interpret what is happening in an area of\\nsubstantive or formal inquiry. There are two criteria for evaluating whether a\\ntheory “works”—the categories must fit and the theory must “work the core of\\nwhat is going on.” Working the core means that the researcher has\\nconceptualized the data in a way that accurately captures the participants’ main\\nconcerns and how they continually address those concerns. Last, the principle of\\nmodifiability dictates that the theory can never be more correct than its ability to\\nwork the data; thus, as the latter reveals itself in research, the former must\\nconstantly be modified.\\nAs an example, I look at the various concepts that I presented in this book\\n(e.g., the armory, minding the gap, disruptive innovation, etc.) and ask, “Do\\nthese categories fit the data? Are they relevant? Do they work the data?” The\\nanswer is yes, I believe they accurately reflect what emerged from the data. Like\\nshame resilience theory, my quantitative colleagues will test my theories on\\nWholeheartedness and vulnerability and we will push the knowledge\\ndevelopment process forward.\\nAs I look back on this journey, I realize the deep truth in the quote I shared at\\nthe beginning of this chapter. There really is no path. Because the research\\nparticipants had the courage to share their stories, experiences, and wisdom, I\\nforged a path that defined my career and my life. When I first realized and\\nresented the importance of embracing vulnerability and living a Wholehearted\\nlife, I would tell people that I was hijacked by my own data. Now, I know that I\\nwas rescued by it.\\nPRACTICING GRATITUDE\\nIt is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful.\\n—Brother David Steindl-Rast\\nTo my literary agents, Jo-Lynne Worley and Joanie Shoemaker: Thank you for\\nbelieving in me and in the work.\\nTo my manager, Murdoch Mackinnon: “You’re a great copilot.
